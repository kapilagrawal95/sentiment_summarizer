-1,-The speaker phone is very quiet.,3,electronics_neu_6
-1,- The phone scratches very easily and does not handle being dropped very well.,3,electronics_neu_6
-1,I drop mine once and ever since its made this horrible buzzing noise.,3,electronics_neu_6
-1,-The main reason I am getting rid of this phone is because of the charging/charger/battery.,3,electronics_neu_6
-1,"Around the second month I had this phone, the charger broke.",3,electronics_neu_6
-1,"When I went to charge it, it would charge for a few minutes, and then stop.",3,electronics_neu_6
-1,Now it wont charge at all.,3,electronics_neu_6
-1,"This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.",3,electronics_neu_6
0,"The Bottom Line: The camera is okay for those who want a high-resolution camera with both digital and optical zoom without spending much more than $100. I bought this camera on sale for $99, then read the reviews very soon after and started having regrets.",3,electronics_neu_8
1,"But for what I paid, the camera has worked pretty well.",3,electronics_neu_8
0,Many reviews refer to battery power issues.,3,electronics_neu_8
1,"I have been able to take more than 30 pictures with a fully charged pair of batteries before they went dead, and it is simple to just carry a spare pair of batteries for backup, as the battery charger that came with the camera accommodates 4 batteries.",3,electronics_neu_8
0,I also read on Gateway's web site that they specifically recommend the nickel (NiMH)AA batteries rather than alkaline.,3,electronics_neu_8
0,"They additionally suggest that lithium AA batteries be used for longer life, although they note that these are more expensive.",3,electronics_neu_8
1,"First the good news...the camera takes nice, sharp pictures when zoom is not used and there is good lighting; it is compact and lightweight; and it is the most inexpensive camera I've seen with both digital and optical zoom and 4 megapixels.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,Now the bad news: It is true that Gateway's customer service is not helpful if there are problems.,3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the ""Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit."" Good luck finding such a kit!",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"First I went to Radio Shack, they didn't have the kit, and had no adapter that would fit the camera.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.",3,electronics_neu_8
0,"So, I called Gateway.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"Yeah, right.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.",3,electronics_neu_8
0,"I contacted Gateway tech services again by live chat, and the tech said that they don't have the kit in stock, but promised to call me within 2 weeks to let me know when it would be available.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"That was about 2 months ago, and I still haven't heard from Gateway.",3,electronics_neu_8
0,"BUT, for anyone who is looking for the Gateway digital camera accessory kit, I did succeed in obtaining it on eBay from an electronics dealer in California (the other side of the country from where I live) that had 110 kits in stock!",3,electronics_neu_8
0,(No wonder Gateway doesn't have any left!),3,electronics_neu_8
0,"For $20 plus $8 for S & H, I received not only the AC adapter, but another battery charger, another pair of batteries, a small tripod, and a camera cover.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"When using the zoom, I find that you must have extremely steady hands when taking the pictures or you will get blurred shots.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.,3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.",3,electronics_neu_8
0,"Overall, the camera is not bad, and I'm satisfied with what I got for what I paid.",3,electronics_neu_8
-1,"The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.",3,electronics_neu_9
-1,"I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.",3,electronics_neu_9
-1,"Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.",3,electronics_neu_9
0,"I called Sony, and they tried to troubleshoot over the phone, but finally concluded that the unit was defective and needs to be replaced.",3,electronics_neu_9
0,"I read reviews of the previous model D300P, and people complained of the same kind of problem I saw with the D500P. I was apprehensive about purchasing it, but saw only good reviews of the D500P, so I thought Sony had the problem licked.",3,electronics_neu_9
-1,"I guess not!""",3,electronics_neu_9
0,"Here's the update: I ordered this unit by mail-order, and called the dealer to arrange to return it.",3,electronics_neu_9
-1,"The dealer informed me that Sony had instituted a new policy requiring that all exchanges have to be directly through Sony. I thought this was hard to believe, and called Sony. Sony confirmed that in fact, this is their policy.",3,electronics_neu_9
-1,They also refused to pay the postage for the return.,3,electronics_neu_9
0,"Given no other choice, I paid the postage and mailed the unit back to Sony's service center in Laredo, Texas. After waiting a month for my replacement, I called Sony's service department.",3,electronics_neu_9
0,"The agent told me that the computer showed it was already sent, and ""it was signed for by your front door.""",3,electronics_neu_9
-1,"I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.",3,electronics_neu_9
0,He then transferred me to another department at Sony which confirmed that it had never been sent.,3,electronics_neu_9
0,They said they would send it out right away by express mail.,3,electronics_neu_9
-1,"A week later, still no replacement unit.",3,electronics_neu_9
-1,"I called Sony again, and again the first agent said it was already sent, then after I explained it hadn't arrived I was transferred to the second department, which again confirmed it hadn't been sent out yet.",3,electronics_neu_9
0,"I demanded to know when the unit would be sent out, and was transferred to a third department to get a tracking number and date of delivery.",3,electronics_neu_9
0,"Finally, after a total of 6 weeks, I received a player.",3,electronics_neu_9
0,"This one was a model D550P instead of D500P, but it looks similar.",3,electronics_neu_9
1,The best news is: This unit works!,3,electronics_neu_9
0,"I have been using this unit for one month, and it plays DVDs satisfactorily, as well as videotapes.",3,electronics_neu_9
1,"Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.",3,electronics_neu_9
0,All functions seem to work appropriately.,3,electronics_neu_9
-1,I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.,3,electronics_neu_9
0,"The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.",3,electronics_neu_9
0,"After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.",3,electronics_neu_9
-1,The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.,3,electronics_neu_9
0,"In summary, I am satisfied with the performance of my Sony SLV-D550P DVD player.",3,electronics_neu_9
-1,"On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.",3,electronics_neu_9
0,Reviewing an antenna is difficult.,3,electronics_neu_10
0,"I could tell you about which channels I get easily with the Terk FDTV2A (ABC, FOX, MyTV, CW, PBS) and which channels I really don't (CBS, NBC), but you don't live in my apartment, so that doesn't do you any good.",3,electronics_neu_10
0,"What I can tell, you, however, is that this antenna doesn't seem to pick up any more channels than the other antennas I've tried, the RCA ANT1500 (returned to retail store) or Amplified Monoprice Antenna (currently in guest room).",3,electronics_neu_10
0,"None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.",3,electronics_neu_10
1,"The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.",3,electronics_neu_10
1,"The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.",3,electronics_neu_10
0,"I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.",3,electronics_neu_10
-1,The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.,3,electronics_neu_10
-1,The power cable (AC adapter) is similarly integrated into the amplifier.,3,electronics_neu_10
-1,"If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.",3,electronics_neu_10
-1,"If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.",3,electronics_neu_10
-1,This whole design seems to create an unnecessary rat's nest of wires behind my television.,3,electronics_neu_10
0,"I also looked at the Terk FDTV1A, which seemed to be the same antenna, but slightly larger.",3,electronics_neu_10
0,"I don't know if a larger antenna would pull in more channels or not, so I went with the smaller FDTV2A given my limited space.",3,electronics_neu_10
0,I'm sticking with what I have...,3,electronics_neu_10
0,"something different might yield better results, but at this point, I'm tiring of trying out antennas and just want to park myself on the couch and enjoy some television!",3,electronics_neu_10
0,Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.,3,electronics_neu_11
0,Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.,3,electronics_neu_11
1,The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV - very impressive.,3,electronics_neu_11
-1,"Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.",3,electronics_neu_11
0,(Why did I buy it if I had freeview already?,3,electronics_neu_11
-1,"It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.",3,electronics_neu_11

0,This product could use some work.,3,electronics_neu_14
1,The hardware itself is simple and well designed.,3,electronics_neu_14
0,It is rugged and simple.,3,electronics_neu_14

-1,You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.,3,electronics_neu_14
-1,Sometimes information is unable to be acquired.,3,electronics_neu_14
1,Customer service though is very good and very responsive.,3,electronics_neu_14
1,This is used for vans in a service company and when it works it works very well.,3,electronics_neu_14
0,The whole idea of its use and presence is more as a deterrent rather then actually as a locator so it does work well for those purposes.,3,electronics_neu_14
1,Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).,4,electronics_pos_12
1,Even picks up my neighbors networks.,4,electronics_pos_12
1,Netgear software makes me buy them over and over...,4,electronics_pos_12

1,"Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.",5,electronics_pos_13
0,This is best done on a tripod to eliminate shake and to keep the object centered.,5,electronics_pos_13
1,Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.,5,electronics_pos_13
1,The camera is light but feels solid.,5,electronics_pos_13
1,Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.,5,electronics_pos_13
1,The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.,5,electronics_pos_13
1,It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.,5,electronics_pos_13
1,Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.,5,electronics_pos_13
1,The P90 exceeds my expectations.,5,electronics_pos_13

1,"Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.",4,electronics_pos_16
1,I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor.,4,electronics_pos_16
0,"It plays 5 cd's with modes like shuffle, repeat and random.",4,electronics_pos_16
1,"So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.",4,electronics_pos_16
1,Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.,5,electronics_pos_18
1,Cons: None so far.,5,electronics_pos_18
0,My wife got it for me account of the wireless capability.,5,electronics_pos_18

1,"I couldn't be happier with the wide lens, aperture control ring, manual functions, scene pre-settings, overall low light performance, and ease of customization this little camera offers.",4,electronics_pos_33
1,Even love the minimal black design of it.,4,electronics_pos_33
1,"I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ($400) and the Canon name (still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively), and as far as image quality I can't really find any faults.",4,electronics_pos_33
0,The included software is necessary however to convert the raw CR2 files into Tiff files for Photoshop.,4,electronics_pos_33
0,Bundled with the included software is a PhotoStitch program that allows you to 'stitch' individual shots together to make panormas.,4,electronics_pos_33
1,Very cool.,4,electronics_pos_33
1,I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.,4,electronics_pos_33
1,There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is.,4,electronics_pos_33

0,This game has a few things going for it.,2,videogames_neg_3
1,It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.,2,videogames_neg_3
1,I am also a big fan of shooting the trees down.,2,videogames_neg_3
1,The single player has some moments that are kind of funny.,2,videogames_neg_3
0,"The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.",2,videogames_neg_3
0,My complaints with the game are as follows.,2,videogames_neg_3
-1,"Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.",2,videogames_neg_3
-1,The graphics are not all that great.,2,videogames_neg_3
-1,The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.,2,videogames_neg_3
-1,Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.,2,videogames_neg_3
-1,"Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.",2,videogames_neg_3
-1,This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.,2,videogames_neg_3
-1,Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.,2,videogames_neg_3
-1,What's the point of that?,2,videogames_neg_3
-1,If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.,2,videogames_neg_3

-1,"Wow, could have been a expansion pack.",2,videogames_neg_4
-1,I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.,2,videogames_neg_4

0,"Oh well, the wait continues for Modern Warfare 2.",2,videogames_neg_4

-1,"That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.",1,videogames_neg_8
0,2K Sports was kicking EA Sports a$$ in the football category.,1,videogames_neg_8
-1,It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.,1,videogames_neg_8
-1,That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...,1,videogames_neg_8
-1,can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???,1,videogames_neg_8

-1,Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.,1,videogames_neg_11
-1,"The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.",1,videogames_neg_11
-1,Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.,1,videogames_neg_11
-1,I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.,1,videogames_neg_11
-1,Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.,1,videogames_neg_11
-1,STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!,1,videogames_neg_11
-1,"I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.",2,videogames_neg_12
-1,"The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.",2,videogames_neg_12
-1,"This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""",2,videogames_neg_12
-1,Ridiculous stuff.,2,videogames_neg_12
-1,The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.,2,videogames_neg_12
-1,Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?,2,videogames_neg_12
-1,"Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.",2,videogames_neg_12
-1,"The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for ""real"" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.",2,videogames_neg_12
-1,I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.,2,videogames_neg_12
-1,"Come on - you don't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces, so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin?",2,videogames_neg_12
-1,"No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.",2,videogames_neg_12
0,"The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.",2,videogames_neg_12
1,"The sound effects are great and accurate, making it seem like you're in a movie (the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming).",2,videogames_neg_12
1,"The visuals and firefights seem great as well, grenade explosions look like they should and the flak being fired into the sky by Germans in fields around you makes it very immersive.",2,videogames_neg_12
0,"The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.",2,videogames_neg_12
0,This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin' for.,2,videogames_neg_12
-1,"I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.",2,videogames_neg_13

0,It's a mindless sort of fun.,2,videogames_neg_13

-1,"Needless to say, I feel very let down.",2,videogames_neg_13
0,At least I still have Fight Night...,2,videogames_neg_13
-1,I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.,2,videogames_neg_17
-1,I doubt the producers have ever been to it.,2,videogames_neg_17
-1,And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?,2,videogames_neg_17
-1,It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.,2,videogames_neg_17
-1,Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.,2,videogames_neg_17
-1,"GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).",2,videogames_neg_17
-1,"Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)",2,videogames_neg_17
-1,and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.,2,videogames_neg_17

-1,GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!,2,videogames_neg_17
-1,The gameplay is not worthy of anything.,2,videogames_neg_17
-1,"There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!",2,videogames_neg_17

-1,"They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?",2,videogames_neg_17
-1,"The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.",2,videogames_neg_17
-1,"It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.",2,videogames_neg_17
-1,"It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.",2,videogames_neg_17

0,I liked it on the dream cast though and wanted to add a different type of fighting game to my collection.,3,videogames_neu_0
1,There are many characters to choose from and almost as many fighting styles.,3,videogames_neu_0
0,Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.,3,videogames_neu_0
0,I purchased this game for the purpose of having this as a quick pick me up with friends and beer.,3,videogames_neu_0
1,The 8 man tournament possible warrants this purchase.,3,videogames_neu_0
-1,Unfortunately the game lacks substance.,3,videogames_neu_0

0,Sounds effects are present but somewhat lacking.,3,videogames_neu_0
-1,"The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).",3,videogames_neu_0
0,The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.,3,videogames_neu_0
0,Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???,3,videogames_neu_0
0,The fighting mechanics consist of Left and right punch buttons and left and right kick buttons.,3,videogames_neu_0
-1,"So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.",3,videogames_neu_0
1,The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.,3,videogames_neu_0

-1,"This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.",3,videogames_neu_4
0,The previous 3 (or 2 in this case) were based on platforming with some 1 on 1 battles for bosses.,3,videogames_neu_4
0,"This game is entirely mission based, you start from doing D ranked missions all the to S rank.",3,videogames_neu_4
0,"While this game is easy for the most part, some missions will cause frustration due to hazards in a level or little time to complete a mission.",3,videogames_neu_4
0,I'm sure most have heard of a game called Jump Super Stars (or Ultimate Stars) before.,3,videogames_neu_4
-1,This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.,3,videogames_neu_4
-1,This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.,3,videogames_neu_4
-1,"To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.",3,videogames_neu_4
-1,Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.,3,videogames_neu_4
0,"Certain characters like Naruto have jutsu's that are highlighted in blue, these jutsu's cover the entire screen meaning there's nowhere to hide and are unblockable at the same time.",3,videogames_neu_4
0,Sakura also has a healing ability that might prolong multiplayer matches.,3,videogames_neu_4

-1,"I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.",3,videogames_neu_4
0,"The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.",3,videogames_neu_4
1,One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.,3,videogames_neu_4
0,RENT or BUY?,3,videogames_neu_4

1,The coloring of the elements are also beautiful.,3,videogames_neu_7
1,The movements of all the characters are smooth and defined.,3,videogames_neu_7

0,"At this point it's just frustrating and not worth playing anymore ~Longevity: 0.1/10~ Time for the real reason I gave SSBB a 4. After SSBB loses its value in single player, it still holds up as a decent party game for a little longer.",3,videogames_neu_7
-1,Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.,3,videogames_neu_7
-1,So sad......,3,videogames_neu_7
-1,"Smash Bros. games are expected to have a perfect replay value, but this one's longevity is INCREDIBLY low.",3,videogames_neu_7

-1,People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.,3,electronics_neu_36
-1,I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.,3,electronics_neu_36
-1,"If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.",3,electronics_neu_36
-1,"Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.",3,electronics_neu_36
1,"When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.",3,electronics_neu_36
-1,But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.,3,electronics_neu_36
-1,Very disappointing.,3,electronics_neu_36
1,"Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.",3,electronics_neu_40
1,"Within its limitations it's excellent, interacting automatically with other apps (like iCal and Address Book) on the Mac. It also simplifies database use in general for those of us intimidated by full FileMaker.",3,electronics_neu_40
-1,"Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.",3,electronics_neu_40
-1,Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.,3,electronics_neu_40
0,"Online discussions have highlighted this shortcoming, and we can hope the first revision will overcome this limitation.",3,electronics_neu_40
0,"Meanwhile, if you do all your computing/database use on a single machine, Bento's fine.",3,electronics_neu_40
-1,"This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.",3,electronics_neu_45
-1,All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.,3,electronics_neu_45
0,Maybe I've not set it up correctly.,3,electronics_neu_45

0,I purchased this clock radio because I thought it was atomic.,3,electronics_neu_58

0,"Sorry, that's the policy.",3,electronics_neu_63
-1,"And I have to call you back on long-distance, and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement, I asked.",3,electronics_neu_63

0,"I bought this printer to serve a small work group of 4 employees, 3 of whom use Macintosh notebooks.",3,electronics_neu_66

0,Snow Leopard is currently unsupported as of the time of this review.,3,electronics_neu_66
1,"To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.",3,electronics_neu_66
1,Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).,3,electronics_neu_66
0,I don't know why Apple doesn't program a similarly useful installer for Mac hardware.,3,electronics_neu_66
0,My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.,3,electronics_neu_66
-1,Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.,3,electronics_neu_66
-1,It's pretty frustrating.,3,electronics_neu_66
1,The printer itself works great.,3,electronics_neu_66
1,"It's fast, printer high quality black and whites, and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.",3,electronics_neu_66
0,"Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.",3,electronics_neu_66

1,"After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher, I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features, (it has features galore!).",5,electronics_pos_44
1,I must say this camera is AWESOME.,5,electronics_pos_44
1,Truly fantastic pictures.,5,electronics_pos_44
1,"Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment, (LCD, HDTV, TV monitors, and digcams), you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture, or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc... well, the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly, practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.",5,electronics_pos_44
0,"Remember 'noise' is part of digital technology and all digital cameras have 'noise'- yes DSLR do too, it's inherent in the technology (pixels).",5,electronics_pos_44
0,"Just like all film cameras will show grain, noticeable under low lighting conditions with film.",5,electronics_pos_44
0,"So, reducing grain in the best of cameras has to do with the film, lighting and the photographer.",5,electronics_pos_44
0,It's the same with reducing 'noise' in digital cameras.,5,electronics_pos_44
0,"If you are getting 'noise' simply set the Pict.Adj to [high noise reduction], use a flash, tripod, or play with some of the controls and learn how to use the camera and lighting to eliminate noise.",5,electronics_pos_44
0,"If the picture on a TV is grainy you adjust the sharpness, contrast etc. the FZ30 is of the same technology (digital/electronic) and has similar menu's.",5,electronics_pos_44
0,"And just as a pro photographer takes great pains by using high power lights and accessories like flash, tripods etc. in low lighting situations even with his high priced camera, high priced lens and thousands of dollars worth of equipment to get a fantastic shot (He doesn't blame the camera, just as an artist doesn't blame his brushes for how his pictures turn out)!?",5,electronics_pos_44
1,"Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.",5,electronics_pos_44
1,"Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.",5,electronics_pos_44
1,It does all you ask of it and more.,5,electronics_pos_44

1,"It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.",5,music_pos_66
1,I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.,5,music_pos_66

0,"Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad, typical GameBoy RPG controls, you'll get used to them very quickly.",1,videogames_neg_33
-1,"Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.",1,videogames_neg_33
-1,"The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.",1,videogames_neg_33
-1,"And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.",1,videogames_neg_33
-1,"You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.",1,videogames_neg_33
-1,"Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....",1,videogames_neg_33
-1,it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.,1,videogames_neg_33
-1,"Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.",1,videogames_neg_33
-1,"Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games, is the overly ''sad'' music.",1,videogames_neg_33
-1,"Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.",1,videogames_neg_33

1,The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.,3,videogames_neu_45
