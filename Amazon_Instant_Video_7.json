The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.

Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the \"cozy\" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I purchased the series via streaming and loved it!", "unixReviewTime": 1318291200, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2011"},

You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.

But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.

You'd think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer's assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.There's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey's Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack's estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Possibly the best 24 yet", "unixReviewTime": 1159660800, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2006"},

For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of \"prisoner's rights\" and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O'Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that's happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it's still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends.

Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).Season 5 is probably my favorite season to date. It starts strong and doesn't let up until it's over.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they've added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn't completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some \"intense\" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best show still in production on Broadcast TV?", "unixReviewTime": 1170288000, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2007"},

The fifth season of \"24\" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It's a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched \"Casino Royale\" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like \"24\" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven't seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode \"prequel\" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There's also a summary of the season included as well athough if you've watched the show (or are watching it now) it won't really provide anything new. Th \"100 Episode Reel\" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven't had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging.

However, Season Five brings some of the attention back to the sitting U.S. President (this time Charles Logan) and ends up with a much more well-rounded storyline.For a basic (non-spoilery) plot summary, a group of Russian terrorists threaten to release canisters of nerve gas in the U.S., leading Bauer to be reprieved from his thought-to-be death in order to help stop the crisis.  As CTU begins investigating the terrorism, however, it quickly becomes clear that the terrorists are working with a high-ranking government official, and the conspiracy begins to be unraveled.To be honest, at first I was skeptical of all the focus on President Logan, as didn't like his character and wasn't sure that he could command the camera as well as his predecessor Palmer.  However, by the end of the season, Logan is easily the most enjoyable/interesting character on the show.  His acting, along with his wife, chief of staff, and head of security, really gives the show the Presidential presence it lacked since that first season.Of course, there is still more than enough of Jack Bauer and his fellow CTU agents (Audrey Rains, Bill Buchanon, Edgar Stiles, Chloe O'Brien, etc.) to go around, which means that intense drama ensues in every single episode.  The writers have an amazing way to take a character that looks like a creep (think Tony Almeida and George Mason in the early seasons) and, by the end of a few episodes, have him become a noble hero, and that tradition continues in this season as well.The only \"knock\" I have on this season is that the cliffhanger endings of each episodes aren't quite as shocking (e.g. Nina Myers doesn't appear out of nowhere).  However, I think that was more of a creative choice by the writers, as the story is actually more coherent that any season besides the first one.  Instead of seemingly changing the plot of the show with every episode, Season Five slowly crescendos until the big finale.So, fans of 24 can purchase this season with confidence knowing that they will still get their action, drama, suspense, and some great twists and turns along the way.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Back To Its Political Roots", "unixReviewTime": 1241049600, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2009"},

{"reviewerID": "AJ7SBFCIXPJM1", "asin": "B000HZEHL6", "reviewerName": "Scot Merideth Peirson \"Scot Peirson\"", "helpful": [10, 10], "reviewText": "It was rough enough for the fans of NCIS to lose Kate Todd by having Ari Haswari snipe her at the end of Season 2.  So, starting Season 3 off by showing Kate's murder from Ari's POV is a little rougher.  But the two episodes that start off Season 3 of NCIS--the two part \"Kill Ari\" episodes--really bring up a subject in this series that hadn't been fully fleshed out.  Obviously, these two episodes allow the regular characters to come to grips with the loss of Kate--the irony of Kate's ghost talking to Ducky and Ducky not talking back to the ghost, the overall story of how the survivors all see Kate.  McGee seeing a superwoman, Abby seeing Elvira, Tony being Tony in seeing Kate (That schoolgirl outfit), and Gibbs seeing Kate as he last saw her--with a hole between her eyes.  Just as obviously, \"Kill Ari\" allows for the introduction of Cote De Pablo's Ziva David, the Mossad/Masada agent liased to NCIS in the wake of Kate's death and Lauren Holly's Jenny Sheppard--Gibbs' former partner/lover who rose beyond working the field to the NCIS director's job.But my observation after a couple of viewings of this box set is that the underlying story of the season is the revelations about the history of Leroy Jethro Gibbs.  For much of the first two seasons, Mark Harmon's \"tough, no-nonsense investigator\" (To quote the liner notes on the set) has always had an understated sense of humor that has allowed him to smile quitely at the office interaction between the members of the team while presenting his harder face.  But that exterior begins to crack in the \"Kill Ari\" episodes; the mystery surrounding Jethro's background begins to unfold as Ari murders Kate, then takes his shot at Abby and captures Dr. Mallard.  This is what starts leading Jethro to being close to Ziva--maybe no one notices, but because of the information that she uncovered about Jethro and fed to her half-brother Ari, Officer David feels partially responsible for Kate's murder.Through Season 3, we start getting clues to who Jethro is and what he keeps from everyone--the flask that we see at the end of \"Under Covers\", his continued attraction towards redheads (It certainly is no coincidence that Holly/Sheppard is a redhead), and the subtleties of his relationship with Ziva--forged in an oddly shared tragedy.  Of course, much of all that goes on in the season comes to a head in the \"Hiatus\" two-parter at the end of the season.  We find out why Gibbs is what he is, how many of his actions have prepared DiNozzo for running the team and prepped Tim for being an agent; and how the discoveries affect his relationship with Dr. Mallard and Director Sheppard.As always since this series started, the performances are stunning.  Mark Harmon continues to embody the toughness and instincts of Jethro, but also had to be very nuanced as Gibbs' painful history comes out.Michael Weatherly's Tony DiNozzo continued being the second coming of David Addison (my usual Moonlighting aside), but Tony had to face growing up and being a decision-maker/leader (\"Bait\"), and had a difficulty through this season that he hadn't had in the previous two--ZIVA.Cote De Pablo flipped the dynamic of the team.  As Ziva, Cote brought a much more formidable presence to the squad.  In the first two seasons, Tony could get Kate off-balance with his remarks and his stunts, offending her Catholic schoolgirl sensibilities.  In the third season, Ziva--partially because of her background, partially because it was just HER--was able to get Tony off his feed more than he thought possible.  An example of this--aside from her driving, or her mangling of slang--came up in \"Probie\", when she was able to get Tony to reveal why he was receiving calls from a sperm bank.  De Pablo was able to affect a very cool and very canny customer in Ziva.  Many viewers are always going to miss Sasha Alexander, but Cote is a wonderful fit.Sean Murray's Tim McGee is still a wonderful work in progress; the nerd-boy field agent who continues to get tortured by DiNozzo in a big-brother/little-brother fashion.  He still seems over his head at times, eager to please Gibbs (Or at least keep Jethro from popping him one in the back of the head--isn't it funny how The Head Slap has become one of the show's many trademarks?).  Plus, there's whatever seems to be going on in his private life, whether or not it's with Abby.Of course, what can be said about Pauley?  Perrette is a scene-stealing wonder on screen, especially in Abby's lab when she's mainlining the \"Kaff-Pow\" or getting Bert to do what he does (Her stuffed hippo--YEAH, THAT ONE).  Plus, we get surprised by Abby's ability with duct tape (\"Frame Up\") and her temper in general (\"Bloodbath\").David McCallum's Dr. Mallard continues to be the second coming of Jonathan Quayle Higgins, though not as prissy as Robin Masters' major domo.  Ducky continues to tell his stories while working his was through the cadavers.  Plus, we get another visit from Nina Foch as Ducky's mom late in the season, getting a surreal moment when she's visiting the NCIS HQ.Many people thought the introduction of Jenny Sheppard as fluff.  Given the underlying story of the season, Lauren Holly's character was actually needed.  Jenny became an insight to Gibbs' relationship issues and why he stays operating as an investigator--basically, she knows certain things about Jethro that his squad aren't privvy to--though as it turns out, she doesn't know the whole story (Until \"Hiatus\").The good guest shots in this set have to start with Sasha Alexander, and her completion of the Catlin Todd storyline.  Her ghost appearing in various forms to the team members was striking (Of course, her schoolgirl outfit in Tony's vision was typical Tony).  Rudolf Martin's Ari Haswari was brilliant--slick, dangerous, deceptive and unstable.  I found myself regretting Ari's storyline being completed--he could have been Wo Fat to Gibbs' McGarrett (Hawaii Five-O reference).  It's always fun when Jessica Steen drops in to trade remarks with Weatherly as Paula Cassidy.  Michael Bellisario's turn as Abby's lab assistant is a comical and dangerous turn.  Finally, we can't forget Muse Watson's introduction in the \"Hiatus\" episodes as Gibbs' mentor when he joined NIS, Mike Franks.  Franks' amusement at the changes--the female director in particular--are tempered by his having to fill in many of the blanks for Gibbs when Jethro is recovering from amnesia.Ultimately, the season of change that is NCIS Season 3 is a storytelling wonder--full of the humor and action that has been the staple of the series since it's beginning, but also the undercurrent of melancholy that permeates this season.  The loss of Kate really becomes the latest in a series of painful losses for Gibbs--but we never realize it until the end of the season.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "NCIS Season 3--Who IS Jethro Gibbs?", "unixReviewTime": 1183680000, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2007"},

After ten years, this video is a very interesting look at the past, and the promises vs. the reality of what became of the Big Dig project.Ironically, or perhaps prophetically, the film begins by showing a section of new tunnel (at time = 2:06). This is the EXACT LOCATION where (on July 10, 2006) the ceiling collapsed on a car, killing passenger Milena Del Valle. The heavy concrete panels were glued in place with epoxy cement that had not been applied properly. It was ultimately determined that ceiling panels weren't actually needed in that location, so today, the ceiling that appears in the video is no longer there.Such was the theme for most of the Big Dig's design and construction. Too many things were \"never attempted before\",  \"biggest in the world\", \"cutting edge\", and/or other custom-designed or unproven technologies. At the same time, the well-connected engineering and construction contractors deliberately made things more complicated and expensive than necessary, so as to maximize their own profits. One notorious example of this became known as the \"Ginzu Guardrails\". Instead of using industry-standard round pipe hand rails in the tunnels, an engineering contractor ordered custom-designed stainless steel hand rails with sharp vertical edges. Besides being much more expensive, they earned the \"Ginzu\" moniker for their ability to slice through accident victims like a knife! Today, many of the original hand rails have been destroyed in accidents and have not been replaced; other sections have been deliberately removed because they are too dangerous. As was the case for the section of ceiling that collapsed, these hand rails were not really needed at all.Of course, it's not all bad; the I-90 extension to the airport has been a great improvement. The Ted Williams tunnel (a.k.a. the Frozen Head tunnel) was one of the first sections to open and the quality of construction is much better than all of the other tunnel sections that were built later. Unfortunately, most of the tunnels under Boston were built very poorly and most disturbingly of all, were not properly sealed to be watertight. In the winter, the leaking water forms huge icicles and ice patches that require application of large amounts of salt inside the tunnels. The large volume of water; combined with the freeze-thaw cycles and corrosive salt effect; was not something the tunnels were designed for. Consequently, the concrete and steel in the tunnels is deteriorating much more rapidly than expected. In another ill-advised design, the aluminum tunnel ceiling light fixtures were attached with steel brackets. Two dissimilar metals in a moist, corrosive environment are always doomed to corrode, and sure enough, in February 2011 the fixtures began falling into the roadway. (they're now temporarily held in place with plastic tie straps, but must all be replaced) As if the initial construction cost wasn't bad enough, the ongoing maintenance costs of the Big Dig will only get worse as the shoddily constructed sections continue to fall apart.I could go on and on about so many other things, but the bottom line is that the cost of the Big Dig was way more expensive than expected and way more expensive than necessary. So much money was spent on this one project, that there was nothing left for other highway projects in Massachusetts, or for the mass transit projects that were initially promised as mitigation for the environmental effects. For most drivers in Boston, the traffic is just as bad if not worse, but instead of being stuck in traffic on Boston's old elevated Central Artery where at least you had a nice view, now you're stuck in traffic in ugly, filthy, crumbling tunnels.The film ends with another ironic quote at time = 33:03 - \"Nobody in five years or ten years is gonna remember the cost, they're gonna look at this thing and say: 'what a beautiful job' \".It would be laughable, if it weren't so very sad.Note for road geeks: Time = 24:05 has a very old aerial view of the Charles River crossing, showing the original elevated ramps that connected the Upper/Lower deck to the Tobin Bridge. Time = 24:42 shows the City Square tunnel under construction in Charlestown, before the loop ramps and Leverett Connector bridge were built.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Boston's \"Big Dig\" - Ten Years Later", "unixReviewTime": 1370131200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2013"},

When I was a small child, I understood that, whether you answered a fourth wall-breaking cartoon character's questions or not, they were going to find out the answer on their own anyway, and it can grow tedious waiting for every little scene that you knew to expect after viewing previous episodes to be over with so the next boring, repetitive scene can appear and bring you closer to the conclusion of the episode. I know that many little children don't realize that Dora will figure out the answers to her endless supply of obvious questions on her own as soon as the blue arrow clicks on a landmark along the path for her, but I did and hated to watch her.

{"reviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "asin": "B000IBUIS0", "reviewerName": "Robert Moore", "helpful": [248, 310], "reviewText": "Warning!  Many spoilers!Additional Warning:  Thanks to Canadian and British television, the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world.  The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run, STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end.  Sorta.  Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works, so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time.  It is hard at this point to know what the show's legacy will be.  It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, FIREFLY, or even BABYLON 5 received, and one can't point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series, but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi.  Yeah, DR. WHO has been around longer, but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids' show (though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation).  It certainly did a number of things right.  The writing remained strong throughout.  The production values were strong from beginning to end.  And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments.  Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation.  Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy.  Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.  I'm a huge fan of kids and having babies, but it doesn't mesh well with making TV shows.  Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle.  Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten.  Black's real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten, with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori.  Adria (played by Monica Baccarin, Inara from FIREFLY) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks.  Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet, who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother, hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala.  Although I have long been a fan of the show, I've long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast.  Though Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill was ever the wise cracker, there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O'Neill and Samantha Carter, no real romantic chemistry.  But Vala is really, truly funny and a real sex post as well.  And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell (which would have been expected, since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi, Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE).  Vala and Jackson are great together, with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson.  As a huge fan of Claudia Black's Aeryn Sun, who was a stern and serious character, it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show.  All in all, her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show.  If I have a regret with the series coming to an end, it is in not knowing what happens to her next.  In one of the most endearing touches of the season, the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team.  The season's opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate, but the week after she is allowed to join, just as the four start to walk through, Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori, a group of ultra religious fanatics.  With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news, with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran (readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with), nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten.  Samantha's father, who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok'ra, finally did die.  And not only Thor, but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge, epic, cliffhanging finales, the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet.  But also, I thought, remarkably appropriate.  I'm sure there was the temptation of a \"Big Ending,\" but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular, intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades.  The main five simply spend some time together, while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss.  Typically, they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end, with only Teal'c retaining any memory of the preceding decades.  As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways.  But we know the potential that remains.So, a classic series comes to an end.  It wasn't the best Sci-fi series ever.  It wasn't the most ground breaking.  And it isn't likely to be one of the more influential.  But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters.  Yeah, it had some unpleasant quirks.  It used \"Science as Magic\" to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself.  It reused plots endlessly.  I mean, just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need?  And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character?  (I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1.)  Still, the show took us to a host of wonderful places, introduced us to some wonderful enemies, and continually managed to entertain and delight.  And we got to know the core group of characters quite well.  Not many shows get ten seasons; even fewer manage ten seasons so well.  The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end, but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do:  last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A fun and dignified final season to Sci-fi longest continuously running series", "unixReviewTime": 1179360000, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2007"},

By the way, this ISN'T the end of SG-1 as two direct-to-video TV movies are due in 2008 with stand alone storylines. During the 10th season we get to see the resolution of the conflict between the alliance and the Ori, the end of the Asgardians and the continuing blossoming romance between Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Vala (Claudia Black). The show went through a lot of change during the last three seasons as storylines were wrapped up, new storyarcs developed and new characters such as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder well known to sci-fi fans from \"Farscape\")and Vala (Claudia Black anther \"Farscape\" alum)providing the show with an additional injection of energy. Beau Bridges came on board adding spark to the show as well. Richard Dean Anderson is missed during the 10th and final season but his spirit is kept very much alive by Browder and Black in their roles. Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge proved to the the strongest link in the chain between the old Stargate and new.The story arc episodes are among the best while some of the stand alone episodes are (with the exception of a few) probably the weakest of the 10th season seeming like filler at times. The stand-alone episodes may or may not appeal to you like those on \"The X-Files\" and \"Farscape\" these episodes stand or fall based on the strength of the plotting and how realistic the wrap up is within 45 minutes. Some episodes as a result are better than others with some abrupt resolutions using the old ex deus machina (represented as help from Stargate Command or other sources sometimes unexpected)where more time could have been devoted to the story expanding it over more than one episode. As a long time \"Farscape\" fan I was happy to tag along after the cast changes and found that if you gave the final two seasons a chance, they were extremely good at the best of times.The show experienced a lot of change during the last three seasons which would make one expect them to be lesser seasons than the previous 7. Nothing could be further from the truth. The new characters were perfect additions to the show adding after the departure of Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O'Neil. The addition of Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry to replace long time cast member Don Davis (Davis' character was promoted and he appeared in a couple of episodes during season nine)who played Major General George Hammond and various guest stars (Fred Willard, Robert Picardo a regular on \"Star Trek: Voyager\" started appearing in season 9) helped spruce up the last season of the show. It also helped that the Ori story arc was nicely resolved during the last season as well.The show looks pretty good but there are some digital artifacts evident in the transfers. Most of you won't notice them or care but for those that do keep in mind the amount of information packed on each disc. The 10th season has been packaged in the slimline packaging that was rolled out with season 8. I'm sure these will show up on Blu-Ray but the show looks fine here and is well priced.The DVD has commentary tracks for every episode except one (and I suspect that was probably an accident as one episode has TWO commentary tracks. They probably scheduled the wrong episode for the second commentary track), deleted scenes, featurettes in the Director's Series focusing on 1 director for 1 episode of each disc. We also got the usual assortment of photo and production galleries included as well. There is a trailer that for the first of the two Stargate direct-to-video movies \"Stargate SG-1: The Ark of Truth\" (the second one also coming in 2008 is \"Stargate SG-1: Continuum\" involving time travel and reportedly will feature Richard Dean Anderson).The 10th season varies but overall it's a good one that SG-1 fans will enjoy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...", "unixReviewTime": 1186272000, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2007"},

He's just a low life who isn't all that shrewd. The fix he's in, because he can't take any more jail time, is what this superb Peter Yates' movie is all about.\"Look.

I done time when I stood up but I can't take no more chances. Next time it's goin' to be me goin' to Florida.\" Now he's facing more prison time for foolishly agreeing to drive a getaway car when he should have asked his friends some questions. He'll do just about anything to cut a deal for no jail time. He's nearly 50. He doesn't want his wife to go on welfare, doesn't want his three kids made fun of because their old man is doing time. He's squeezed by Dave Foley to inform...and Eddie decides he'll rat a little. He's too believing to understand he might be tagged for ratting big time. It's all betrayal, but Eddie doesn't really understand betrayal. All those friends of Eddie's make us wary every time we meet them: Scalise (Alex Rocco), who robs banks, sometimes violently; Jackie (Steve Keats), the dangerous dealer in stolen machine guns; Dillon (Peter Boyle), owner of a low-life bar who knows more about things than Eddie does.The movie looks as hopeless as the Boston weather. It's the cold end of fall, filled with drab, chill days where parking lot asphalt is always wet. We're into Eddie's life in the low lane, where the anchors in the crummy strip malls are a tired Woolworth's and Barbo's Furniture Store. It's a lousy life and it belongs to Eddie Coyle. \"Have a nice day.\"Director Peter Yates sets up scenes -- an exchange of machine guns, a bank robbery, a family held hostage, a stakeout in a commuter train lot, a night on the town -- that are so naturally established that we might miss how skillfully they build the story and show us Eddie's life. We're never sure if things are as hopeless for Eddie as they seem. Yates keeps us on edge, and he adds layers of Eddie Coyle's sad and foolish trust.This is one of Robert Mitchum's best performances. Mitchum still looks like he might be a tough guy, but his Eddie Coyle is a man who has had the force of his life wrung out of him. He's been in the life forever. He does the jobs others ask him to. He doesn't ask very many questions. He's just not smart enough.

True, many of his films were not worthy of his talent, but when he did get a good script (e.g. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON, CAPE FEAR), his performance was always mesmerizing.Arguably, Mitchum's finest screen performance can be found in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE (1973), now available on DVD from The Criterion Collection.Directed by Peter Yates, who supplies audio commentary on the disc, the film is set in Boston and casts Mitchum as a small-time felon, a family man facing a 2-5 year sentence on a smuggling conviction.  His only hope of avoiding prison is to give an FBI agent (Richard Jordan) information that will help to bring down some bigger bad guys...like the men who have been on a bank-robbing spree and killed a teller during their last job.Mitchum's problem is that, if he \"rats\" on those guys, his life is not worth a plugged nickel.Peter Boyle co-stars in the picture, playing Mitchum's \"friend,\" a former felon who is now a bartender and also supplies confidential information to the Feds.Adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins by Paul Monash, this is a gritty, first-rate crime drama, shot in almost a semi-documentary style.

Higgins, is exemplary of the kind of film noir that was unique to the 1970s. It shares the chaotic noir world with films of the 1940s, but protagonist is fast being rendered irrelevant by a rapidly changing world where even corruption isn't what it used to be, and he knows it. It's fitting, then, that the protagonist should be played by an aging Robert Mitchum, conflicted hero of more than a few films of the classic noir cycle. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a hood who runs guns for the Boston mob. Caught in a recent trucking job set up by his bar-owning friend Dillon (Peter Boyle), Coyle is looking at a probable 3-5 years in prison. He can't afford to do the time, so he considers snitching on his gun supplier to a federal agent, Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), but the feds are more interested in a recent string of bank robberies.Eddie Coyle is a man from another era. He ponders how much and whom he is willing to betray to keep himself out of prison. He paternalistically lectures his young gun supplier (Steven Keats) about how rough the business is and the importance of caution and reliability. Eddie is playing by some old rulebook that is no longer applies. He doesn't realize he's being played by just about everyone. He catches on too late to how the game of cops and robbers is currently conducted. \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" was an ironic title for a cynical and depressed era. Made the year the Watergate scandal broke, it's hardly surprising that law enforcement is portrayed as no more ethical than outright criminality. Shot on location in Boston, director Peter Yates' style is unadorned but includes a lot of procedure -how guns are obtained and banks robbed- that enhance the film's aura of authenticity.The DVD (Criterion Collection 2009): Spine #475. Bonus features are a Stills Gallery of 22 behind-the-scenes images captioned by director Peter Yates and a feature commentary by Yates, recorded in 2009. This is one of Yates' favorite 3 films of the 25 films he directed.

The movie reminded me of \"The Sopranos\" more than classic film noir. \"Eddie Coyle\" is more realistic and subdued than a lot of noir. It also has a lot of criminals interacting: pulling capers, making deals, and distrusting each other, like some of the criminals in \"The Sopranos\". It's centered more on the interaction of the characters and the story than on action. There are several great scenes, where the dialogue and the acting are engaging, particularly when Robert Mitchum speaks. I've never been a fan of Robert Mitchum, but here he's excellent, bringing a lot of emotion and weariness to Eddie Coyle. The story is also very good, as we see Eddie struggle to stay out of jail.

I like the way they spun off the whole Atlantis discovery as the foundation for extending SG-1 which was great, but ran it's course and was in decline at the end.  It allowed some new characters, albeit with familiar personalities, along with keeping alive some old favorites with vague tie in's to their ongoing lives as well as bringing Samantha Carter back for a season to head the program (in addition to all her guest appearances).  I think the 3rd season of Atlantis was its best.  I knew from the start it would have a shorter shelf life than SG=1 because the premiss had already been pretty thoroughly explored in SG=1. A whole new universe allowed for some new bad guys, but the SG teams and the predicaments they can get into are finite before they are like plots different show.  I enjoyed their greater familiarity with the ancient technology but being Hyperspace or Warp drives, the technology is simply a backdrop to the episode storyline and seasonal/show ones.  I couldn't have stood waiting as long watching Stargate for them to develop defensive technologies and fight the enemies effectively.  I enjoyed the show and season 3 was at its peak as it was becoming a formula rotated through the seasons by season 4 and season 5 it is hard to get enthused when it begins by them canning a long time character who was well liked by fans and characters, replacing her with someone that I would have enjoyed having run Stargate for two shows and then get eaten by a Raithe no matter how much they tried to make it fun watching him have to change his ways to deal with the realities of being in the field.  The characters had become familiar such that losing main ones was difficult in this season making for some heavy shows, but also began the rotation that made it less upsetting when one was lost.  The only thing that sort of always left me in question was how on Atlantis they dealt with exploring an entire Galaxy with a few SG teams while back in the Milky Way they had a ton.  I realize there were more finite resources in the beginning, but by season 3 they had the huge city fairly up and running and enough trade partners to support a much larger military presence which all things considered I think back home on earth they would have been cranking out as many starships as possible because in the big picture they would need a fleet not a couple of ships.  i know they added on, but over years given the stakes I believe an international governing body would be funding mass production of those things so there was always one by earth, one by Atlantis and others for missions and with force.  It is part of what started to become a little to familiar, the desperate situation with impossible odds solved by a miraculous discovery at the last minute.  Great for a show, or a movie, but when it becomes cyclical it eventually translates to a show formula and the interest just begins to wane.  I did appreciate the writing around the problems they faced were of their own making many times (waking the wraithe early, messing with the replicator programming, genetic experiments on the wraithe to make them human) and the moral questions they raise in parallel with the real world application of genetics.  How much knowledge is to much before we are dabbling in areas we don't have enough seem to be evolved enough to have in our hands as they represent to much power, to much danger.  But for Star Gate fans I think Atlantis was a comfortable spin off that allowed a few more years of enjoyment of their &#34;world&#34; but unlike the Star Trek franchise that dealt with all universes the &#34;world&#34; created via the stargates became to self contained limiting the growth of the plots.  Bottom line is by this season you know what your getting and enjoying it, where in the seasons to come it started to get old and thus the show faded away.  Good, even great for periods, but limited from the start by being set in the present.

Sure, they appear in a few good episodes, but it didn't seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.Second, killing off Dr. Beckett.  I really liked him.  Maybe I'm dating myself a bit here, but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head.  This very lovable character will be missed.Third, rehashing the replicators.  With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series, why do the replicator thing all over again?  It was original enough on Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too.  Are they going creatively bankrupt already?Fourth, rehashing old sci-fi standbys, like the \"weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other\".  Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode \"The Naked Time\" and wasn't it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series?Fifth, bringing back a whole ship full of \"ancients\" just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode.  So, the \"ancients\" have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device.  We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two.  Couldn't an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters?  Wouldn't that have been interesting?  They could have helped explore the rest of the city.  Their ship could have been recovered.  There's so much that could have been done with them that wasn't.Sixth, lack of character development.  Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom, but she seems little more than a pretty (to say the least) face with a great body who never uses contractions (reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie) and tilts her head a lot.  And then there's Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he's still there.Still, the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of.

There are multiple spoilers in the following review!I've watched STARGATE ATLANTIS from the beginning and have more or less enjoyed it from the start.  I definitely plan on continuing to watch it, but I have some concerns about the show that I'm convinced have to be addressed for it to continue to be worth watching.First and foremost, ATLANTIS has always had and continues to have serious cast problems.  They have now had three complete seasons to address these problems and while they have played with it some, most of their decisions have been odd at best.  I really like Joe Flannigan as Sheppard and David Hewlett as Rodney, but beyond that the cast is mainly made up of liabilities.  There was one other actor I liked a lot on the show, Paul McGillion as Beckett, but inexplicably in remaking the cast they chose to kill off one of the few strong characters on the show.  Rachel Luttrell as Teyla is more baffling.  Her character has never been very interesting, but I'm not convinced that Luttrell is untalented.  I suspect that for whatever reason the writers have simply not been willing or able to come up with any interesting arcs for her (apart from having an interesting connection to the wraiths, which by and large has been underutilized).  My hope is that they will rethink Teyla and either do both her and us a favor and kill her off, or become more aggressive in writing her character and give her some significant arcs and character development.  Jason Momoa as Ronon, however, is probably a lost cause.  He is perhaps the most wooden actor on television today and they have done virtually nothing of interest with his character.  David Nykl, however, is good as Zelenka.  I always enjoy his scenes with Rodney.  Finally, I really want to like Torri Higginson (not least because she bears a scary resemblance to an ex-girlfriend of mine).  I love shows that feature strong and interesting female characters, but after three years she remains yet another character with whom they've been unable to do very much.  In her case, however, it appears that the producers have decided to either write her out of the show entirely or reduce her merely to a recurring character.  I will continue to watch and sometimes enjoy STARGATE ATLANTIS, but they really need to do some serious rehabilitation.Some help is on the way.  We know that Amanda Tapping and her character Samantha Carter will be moving over from the cancelled STARGATE SG-1 to become the new head of the Atlantis project.  I think she will bring more strength to the role than Torri Higginson did.  Normally I would also applaud the casting of Jewel Staite as the new base doctor.  I loved her on FIREFLY as Kaylee, but I still regret Beckett's leaving the show.  But I honestly feel that the cast needs several more major changes.  The show has had to rely far too heavily on Sheppard and Rodney.The end of Season Three did, however, leave hope for new and better things.  Atlantis has emerged as the name not of a location that cannot be moved, but of a truly mobile city that can relocate . . . well, to anywhere.  The season ends with the city blasting off into space.  I'm anxious to see what happens next.  But whatever they do, I would like to see the show continue the risks it started taking in Season Three.  Killing Beckett was an abominable mistake (especially given that there were some other characters who could have been killed with far greater profit to the show), but it at least started giving the show something that both it and SG-1 have always lacked:  a body count.  The good adventure shows have body counts.  SG-1 had next to none.  The only truly heartbreaking death in ten seasons was when Dr. Frasier was killed.  It is no accident that that the episode in which that occurred was one of the finest in the series' run.  If you don't have a body count, you get no sense of danger.  On shows like BUFFY, LOST, and BATTLESTAR GALACTIC they have killed off some important characters.  As a result when a character is in danger you get a degree of danger that you never, ever get on ATLANTIS or SG-1.  Well, at least until they killed off Beckett and at least seriously injured Weir.  I dearly hope they continue doing this in the future.I also hope that we see Season Four taking the stories of the Wraith and the replicators to newer and more complex levels.  The series has had some great moments over the first three seasons, especially when they let situations get really desperate.  Hopefully they will continue to do this.While Season Three frequently left me wanting more due to the weaknesses in the overall cast, there were some great moments.  The season finale (both SG-1 and ATLANTIS have had some fine season enders) was splendid.  And the season featured what may be my favorite episode of the entire series so far in \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a wraith who is allowed to feed on no one else.  Christopher Heyerdahl has played several wraiths on the series, but in this episode he was allowed to give this particular wraith a dignity and complexity not allowed any other wraith with the exception of Michael.  He gradually drains the life out of Sheppard out of sheer necessity before the two of them, cooperating as human and wraith never have before, manage to escape from the Genii.  Then, in a moment that could lead to interesting plot developments in the future, we discover that the wraiths cannot only drain another creature of life, they can also imbue them with it, and as a sign of comradeship he heals Sheppard.  I want arcs like this one!  On a host of other series some of the most interesting characters have been those who came over from the other side.  On STAR TREK: VOYAGER, we had Seven of Nine; on BUFFY we had Angel, Anya, and Spike; currently on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA we have Sharon Agathon and (possibly) Caprica Six; and on SG-1 we had Teal'c.  I think it would be fascinating if they could do something like that with a wraith.So I wait for the beginning of Season Four with some nervousness.  The show has some weaknesses and problems, but they are fixable.  The series has not lost any of its potential.  But until we see how the new city in the air Atlantis works in terms of story and how the new cast changes affect the chemistry we won't know for sure.  One thing is for certain.  Season Four should bear little resemblance to any of the first three seasons.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good at times but overall fails to realize its potential", "unixReviewTime": 1183852800, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2007"},

I kept looking forward for nighttime to watch an episode.One thing I like about this season is that some episodes follow on the previous ones. In other words, many episodes are not standalone. Many viewers do prefer standalone episodes, and producers certainly do. For producers, having standalone episodes means a viewer can jump in and watch the series at anytime during the season. This has the benefit of increasing ratings. For some viewers, standalone episodes are also an advantage since they can watch and enjoy an episode without having seen any other episodes. I, on the other hand, prefer continuity, sort of like 24 Hours. For this reason, I thought this season of Stargate Atlantis to be the best.I do have a few comments about this season:1. Dr. Beckett dies in a very simple plot. I was really very disappointed. Beckett was one of my favorite characters, and I often wished he was given more of a principal role. The writers also did a lousy job in the episode in which he was killed. They could have killed him off in two or three one-hour episodes that followed up on each other, thus adding more suspense and thrill. On the other side of the coin, though, killing off a principal character also means that all characters on the show are susceptible to death--none are superhuman. We know James Bond never dies in his movies. However, next time a character is threatened with death in Stargate Atlantis, we will be glued to our seats, wondering whether he or she will die! `Death in the air' makes the episodes more suspenseful.2. The character of Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) has not been developed, and she does not have much to say that is interesting. She is also dressed up in a way to make her look sexy. Shouldn't she be wearing a uniform? Can you imagine a female soldier in Iraq wearing her outfit?3. Jason Momoa as Ronon is another underdeveloped character. Sometimes he is annoying. He also is sparsely dressed, being topless most of the time. Like Teyla, I would imagine he'd wear a uniform. Don't they ever get cold?4. Dr. Weir's (Torri Higginson) character is also weak. She should be given more principal roles. There are rumors that she might be replaced in upcoming seasons.5. There is too much Rodney in this season, and this gets to be annoying at times.6. In one episode, a ship full of ancients is found. They reclaim Atlantis, and basically kick out the Stargate team from the city, who all return back to Earth. However, in the second episode they are all killed. That was really bad storytelling. As one reviewer pointed out, couldn't an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters in latter episodes? They could have helped explore the rest of the city and reveal its many secrets. We could have also known more about the ancients and their culture. Furthermore, their ship could have been recovered and used to fight the Wraiths. There's so much that could have been done with the surviving ancients that wasn't.7. The episode \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a Wraith was fascinating. We discover that the Wraiths not only drain another creature of life, but can also give life as well. For the first time, a bond is formed between a Wraith and a human. Wraiths are shown to be human after all. Humans hunt and kill prey (animals) in order to survive. Wraiths kill humans because we are prey to them, and they need to feed on us to survive. Viewed in this context, aren't Wraiths and humans the same? It all boils down to survival of the fittest.The season ends with the city blasting off into space. Having lost all power, it just floats in space. I can't wait for season 4!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best season so far.", "unixReviewTime": 1206144000, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2008"},

They also want Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) dead or anyone else who has tried to help Scofield and his brother.

When it ended, with the escape of 8 of the convicts; I wondered how they would keep the show going. Well, they did it...The 2nd season is different from season 1 in scenery and in story. And, I'm going to get this out of the way right now, it's not quite as good as season 1. The first season was smart, suspenseful, and entertaining. Season 2 is suspenseful and entertaining...But not a single episode on here captured the heart-pounding 2nd to last episode of season 1. Still, viewing all these episodes a 2nd time (I watched them all while they were airing); It's still an amazing show. When the show begins; Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) have successfully broken out of Fox River. Along with them are John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare), Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco),David \"Tweener\" Apolskiss (Lane Garrison, who's had a recent run-in with the law himself), Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell (Robert Knepper), Benjamin \"C-Note\" Miles Franklin, and Haywire. With the entire world knowing their faces, they \"Fox River 8\" begin running...With new character, F.B.I. man Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) guessing their every move. This season develops the relationship between Michael and Sara, the doctor who aided the cons in their escape, and also makes you feel more for the characters. One amazing aspect of this show is that you actually like the characters and want them to succeed despite their wrongdoings. The best example I have of this is the character T-Bag, a convicted rapist & pedophile who is easily the most dangerous of the bunch. Many viewers of this show have a strong connection to T-Bag and love the character. This is not a result of good writing, but a result of good acting. Robert Knepper plays this character so well, you root for T-Bag to succeed. You don't want to see him killed off or shipped back to prison. The fact that the Emmy awards haven't even acknowledged Knepper is a complete travesty. If this was a movie, Knepper would be nominated for an Oscar. But all the actors are good and with season 2, they've only got better at playing the roles. They're gotten under their character's skin and have really became them. The chemistry between Miller and Purcell is terrific. You believe that they are actually brothers. Fichtner as Mahone is terrific as well. He has that icy stare and intenseness that John Malkovich has and does an amazing job as the sympathetic F.B.I. agent that you love to hate. Like I said, the show isn't as smart as season 1...There's many episodes where they seemed to make up things as they went along (Michael's tattoo has become a ploy and a plot device. The writer's can make new tattoos appear whenever they wish) and the way they handled the Haywire character could have been better. There were times when they disregarded him for several episodes, when really he should have been caught by episode 3. There's no way that Haywire could've remained out longer than Abruzzi. But the suspense factor is way up there. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next (Even though, I already knew which makes it even more impressive). If you haven't jumped on the \"Prison Break\" bandwagon yet, you should...I missed the season 3 premiere last night and I truly want to cry, because I can't wait to see what happens next. When you have a TV show that can you get that pumped up, you know you've found something special...And \"Prison Break\" is damned special all right.

The first was by replacing Jonathan Adams (Dr. Daniel Goodman) with Tamara Taylor (Dr. Camille Saroyan) as Brennan's boss, who, by the way, had a romantic relation with Booth when they were in New York. The second was to introduce a romantic interest for Brennan, in the form of FBI agent Tim Sullivan (Sully), who replaces Booth while he is sidelined for a psychiatric evaluation by the premier guest character on \"Bones\", Gordon, Gordon Wyatt, played by Stephen Fry.Wyatt and Booth have some of the most delicious scenes outside of the episodes where Booth and Brennan get close.In retrospect, it is just a bit hard to take the interchange between Brennan and Saroyan in the first few episodes. Booth is surprised at her arrival, and resists Saroyan's direction. I suppose the reason it's odd is because we all suspect from the outset that in the lab, and with Booth, Brennan will always be the alpha dog. After all, the show is named after her.Overall, I would say season 2 is as good as season 1, and better than season 3 (It is rated better than both seasons 1 and 3.)

As presented in widescreen, here's Season 2 of Bones. The great news is that there's no slack off at all from season one's most excellent run. Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama, humor, pathos, and tenuous romance. Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) continue to dazzle as television's most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person, Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark. She remains dispassionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail, the truth. As always, her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases. As ever, the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the, to her, bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum. Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones' supremely confident exterior. She and Boreanaz are magical, and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There's a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode, but that doesn't keep me from being sofa-ed in rapt attention. This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth's: \"Keep talking. I'll catch up.\" The mysteries are compelling enough, but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements, it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more. The squints, while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks, are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters. The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky, bolstered by this season's newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O'Neal, Stephen Fry, and the wonderful Patricia Belcher (as no-nonsense attorney Caroline Julian). It must be noted that T.J. Thyne (Hodgins) and Michaela Conlin (Angela) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls, beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan (Taylor) as Brennan's new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute, with whom Bones instantly clashes. Then mix in some office romances (except the one we're hankering for). Offer up a serial killer or two. And, thru all the cases she works on, Bones still fixates on her mother's unsolved murder and her father's disappearance. On this, some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are \"The Truth in the Lye\" (Tub of goo!! So cool tub of goo!! To quote Bones: \"Even for me, this is disgusting.\"), \"The Woman in the Sand\" (Booth goes ultimate fighting and, Omigawd, Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress!), \"Aliens in a Spaceship\" (Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out; raw-emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel), the nerve-wracking \"The Blonde in the Game\" and its equally harrowing follow-up \"The Man in the Cell\" features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season's \"A Man on Death Row\") and the season-ender \"Stargazer in the Puddle\" (Bones learns more about her mother).Special Features include optional episode commentaries on \"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\" (with Emily Deschanel) and on \"Stargazer in a Puddle.\" Boreanaz doesn't commentate this time; perhaps, his effort last season was deemed too loopy. Disc 6 offers \"The Memories in the Season\" featurette; \"Visceral Effects: The Digital Illusions of Bones\" featurette; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers; and the gag reel.By the way, the episode commentary on \"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\" reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season.

Yet this second season is quite new in several aspects.First and foremost the season is widely open to personal matters and it explores the private, and at times not so private, relations between the members of the team, after the boss has been changed to a woman, which rebalances the sexual ratios. Bones herself is courting and going out with an FBI agent who has temporarily replaced Booth while he was sort of suspended and deprived of a gun after shooting a clown on top of an ice-cream vendor's van. But in the end she will not go through the process completely as far as leaving the Jeffersonian for a life of full leisure and farniente.Zack manages to get his doctorate and to be hired in the job he was holding as an intern because he goes to Angela and begs for help on his  look and manages to become presentable, which means he can now stand in court and testify seriously in a deportment that can carry the agreement of the jury. So far he is no longer obsessed by sexuality but he encounters a great difficulty: he is summoned by the White House to go to Iraq. But this time this reference does not lead to any political dissertation or even cogitation on the subject. Political questions are systematically and carefully avoided in this second season.Jack and Angela are finally realizing they love each other and even decide to get married and they finally find themselves in front of a priest (in fact a black priestess) in some church for the last step when the State Department steps in and reveals Angela is already married in some kind of broom stick over-jumping ceremony. More later, I guess.Booth is entangled in the hands of a British shrink after his shooting the clown on the ice-cream vendor's van and he is a perfect sucker, building a full barbecue for the shrink under the shrink's blackmailing procedure of retaining the document he must sign. This same shrink will also step into Bones' psyche as some kind of private counselor. Agent Booth and Doctor Brennan will not be able to establish some kind of personal relationship, especially since Temperance's father reappears in her life and even saves the situation a couple of times. But he has to be arrested by Booth and be brought to court for his ancient crimes, including the attack against the deputy chief of the FBI, though this one was crooked to the utmost, his lips kissing the heels of his shoes or something like that.Booth reestablishes for a short while a relationship with the new boss of the institute, Dr Camille Saroyan, with whom he had had a liaison some time ago in another life. But that cannot last more than one or two episodes. This is characteristic of all these people: they are unable psychologically or administratively to build balanced and normal relationships. Is it a side effect of their jobs or professions, we can wonder, or simply  personal immaturity?That level of the season blurs out the various crimes and cases they examine and solve. And these cases do not deal with political issues or even with immigration, except one case about some strange Chinese practice of burying the bones of a man with the bones of a woman so that the man has some company on the other side of the road. Most cases are plain simple crimes in America and among Americans. But they often deals with social problems like the mother of a severely handicapped girl: what can the mother do to help her child the genetic victim of a deadly disease that keeps her retarded, even if it is only for a short time before she dies? Some of these questions are crucial: do we have the right to experiment on human beings new treatments that would enable astronauts to reinforce their bones that get highly decalcified due to prolonged sojourn in space?Some of the cases are plain vicious crimes and it is fun to catch the killers who are most of the time not at all the one or the ones we were expecting. Suspense is always with us even if the personal and more sentimental level of this season makes that suspense not as intense as I would personally prefer it to be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "To be married or not to be married", "unixReviewTime": 1295049600, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2011"},

And decides to come back to NCIS for good, the stories in season four are outstanding. The Halloween story alone is worth watching, as a marine is attacked in his home. And his daughter is kidnapped, and all throughout the case, Ziva thinks that the Daughter's mother is the one who kidnapped her own daughter. But alas, in the end she is wrong.  Or the creepy episode, \"Smoked\". Where a body is found in a chimney, the body of a sadistic serial killer with a toe in his stomach, only come to find out his wife was the actual killer. As she buried the bodies in their yard, and the episode ends with Gibbs asking fornell how he thought the toe got in the guys stomach. There are two threads of stories throughout this season, one is Tony has a new girlfriend, and Gibbs has a Girlfriend Col. Hollis Mann. We also find out, that Mcgee is a fictional writer. We're introduced to Shariff, in two incredible episodes, where they stop the terrorist the first time, and Gibbs is almost killed the second time they meet. Also in this season, we eventually find out that Tony's girlfriend is his undercover assignment for Director Shepard. As she tries to get an international arms dealer  La Grenoulle, now Ducky had been mad at Gibbs for quitting, but eventually they become friends again. And Paula Cassidy and her team are killed in an explosion, in a really powerful episode, season four ends with Jeanne and Dinnozo getting in a limo, which is her father's, and there is La Grenoulle. Season four again, is the last of the great NCIS seasons.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "while it's complicated, it's good.", "unixReviewTime": 1346976000, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2012"},

The main characters all seem to start in different areas--Gibbs in Mexico, Tony as Team Leader, Tim no longer the \"Probie\", Ziva being Ziva...but as the season rolls on, all the lines start coming together.  Jethro's return from Mexico isn't exactly greeted by Jenny Sheppard, and Ducky Mallard's indifference to Gibbs is puzzling.  Tony is in a serious relationship (Or is he?), and it's driving Ziva to distraction.  Tim has suddenly come into money--lots of it, evidently.  Abby is falling for a little person.  Ducky's assistant Jimmy Palmer is finding himself in a hot affair with the new Probie.And Jenny is running an off-the-books investigation that gets the Christians In Action (Initials, folks) upset at NCIS.It's a complicated season where all the characters undergo some changes; mostly pleasant but some not.  Mark Harmon brings Gibbs back from Mexico a little softer (Though not to the team)--enough to allow himself a relationship.  Michael Weatherly gets to have Tony grow up--some--and have his well-known intrusiveness into his coworker's private lives flipped on him by Ziva.  Cote De Pablo allows the Mossad liason to fall for an ill-fated nuclear inspector in \"Dead Man Walking\", but Ziva starts having \"Tony issues\" that don't slap her in the face until the end of the season.  Pauley Perrette's Abby is as she ever is--the attempt to give up \"Kaff-Pow!!\" was classic.  David McCallum's Ducky allows some hurt to show through in his relationship with Gibbs early in the year.  Brian Dietzen and Liza Lapira's sequences in-and-around the morgue were wonderful asides, and made up for the missing \"head slaps\".But Lauren Holly was most intriguing in this season.  She took a character which some viewers considered cheesecake in Season 3, and gave her a very uneasy edge.  The investigation of La Grenouille seemed legitimate, but as the season went on, Jen's personal stake--and what it could cost NCIS--became apparent.  This led to Sheppard not being cast in a good light through much of the second half of the season.This season also became a good spotlight for many of the recurring characters.  Certainly key to the season were Susanna Thompson--Hollis Mann, the CID investigator who got Gibbs' attention--and Scottie Thompson as Jeanne Benoit, the doctor who made DiNozzo settle down.  Joe Spano's usual visits as T.C. Fornell, the FBI agent/friend/rival to Jethro were a delight.  But Muse Watson's Mike Franks--Gibbs' team leader when Jethro first joined the then-NIS--was a treat; an old-fashioned type who got things done not within the rules (Wonder where Jethro got that from?).  We lose Jessica Steen's Paula Cassidy in \"Grace Period\", and that's a shame.  But Armand Assante's was insidious and slick as \"The Frog\", and David Dayan Fisher's turn as Trent Kort--the CIA operative in with La Grenouille--is also notable.In it's run, NCIS has always had an ongoing storyline that gets buried in the usual action--the identity of the terroist who infiltrated the MTAC in Season 1, the return of Ari leading to the two words (\"Sorry, Caitlin\") at the end of Season 2, and the uncovering of Jethro's life story in Season 3.  Season 4 becomes about Jenny's  investigation/obsession, and how it affects the whole office.  It is aninteresting and ominous turn in the series.  It does require the viewer to follow along closely, but in the end, all the main characters find themselves at the center of the puzzle.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "NCIS Season 4--The Labyrinth", "unixReviewTime": 1198540800, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2007"},

Whoever would have thought that poking around with microscopes and spectrum analyzers and picking up little bits of fluff at a Los Vegas crime scene with a set of tweezers could be interesting? But yes, it was and has continued to be for going on eight seasons now and has given rise to a couple of variants set in New York and Miami. All three of the CSI iterations offer a distinct challenge to a viewer who possesses a decent ration of curiosity about puzzles and mysteries but a very, very low gross-out threshold. CSI season 7 mercifully let up a little on the really gross visualizations and focused a little more on the puzzles. Nothing I watched this season sent me gagging from the room, so either they let up or I have gotten a little more used to maggoty corpses.Three of the special features in this collection focus specifically on episodes which made season 7 stand a little apart. The first is  a `making of'  \"Built to Kill\" a two part episode set backstage at the astonishing Cirque d Soliel, another covers  the definitive stunt-casting of all time;  Roger Daltry playing five different guest parts in \"Living Legend\".  And a third extra feature focused on the hunt for the \"miniature\" killer, which continued intermittently all though the season. I found the \"Miniature Murders\" feature to be especially fascinating, as I had built many inch-to-a-foot scale model interiors and buildings. Having a series of perfectly replicated half-inch-to-a-foot murder scenes showing up within hours of a real, full-sized murder offered a puzzle to Grissom and his crew that lasted all season. Very obviously, it would have taken an artisan of miniatures days and weeks to build such a detailed replica, and the feature made it very clear what a challenge it was, even with the resources available to a television studio. Other extras include commentary tracks for seven episodes, and a tour of the real CSI-Las Vegas offices; which, astonishingly enough, are very much more cluttered and not nearly as plush-looking as the series sets.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sherlock in the Lab", "unixReviewTime": 1237680000, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2009"},

Having said that ...Each season I keep saying the same thing, - this show keeps getting better and better. I feel this show always manages to stay fresh and interesting and I love it more and more with each new season. I can't wait for this release.The first episode in this season is Built To Kill where we are waiting to see more of what we found out in the last episode of season 6 - that Grisolm and Sara had gotten together. My favourite episode is Happenstance where identical twins have been seperately killed and the team try to work out whether the case is related or not. If you want a total recap of each episode then here it goes:Built To Kill 1 - Foul play is suspected when an apparent suicide victim still has the gun in his hand, and a flower delivery woman is found crushed to death in the middle of a Cirque du Soleil performance. (Look for a special appearance from John Mayer.Built To Kill 2 - Grisolm investigates the murder of a rock star, which is complicated by the discovery of a miniature replica of the crime scene at the house. And Catherine tries to determine if she was raped after waking up nude in a seedy hotel.Toe Tags - A group of dead bodies in the Las Vegas morgue get to know each other while CSI tries to solve the crimes that got them there.Fannysmackin' - (another favourite of mine) A gang of street thugs is beating and killing people all over the city. Greg witnesses one of the crimes taking place and becomes a beating victim himself.Double Cross - A lounge singer is found crucified inside a Catholic church, and the church's new pastor fails to disclose that he knows the victim from all the way back to high school.Burn Out - A pedophile arsonist maintains his innocence in the disappearance of two young boys, but he is also willing to help the investigation by giving Grissom insight on the potential kidnapper's mindset.Post Mortem - Greg has his day in court for running over and killing a street gang member right before his own beating, and a second crime scene replica is found--this time after the murder of an elderly woman.Happenstance - CSI investigates the deaths of estranged identical twins: one from a gunshot wound, and one from an apparent suicide. The two deaths do not appear to be related, but are they?Living Legend - (the only boring episode) The team searches for a link between a current string of murders in Las Vegas and a notorious mob boss who disappeared in the 1970s.Loco Motives - Gil finds a third miniature crime-scene replica at a murder site, and CSI tries to find a link between the three otherwise-unrelated murders.Leaving Las Vegas - Catherine tries to link an accused killer to a second similar crime in a small town after he is found not guilty in the first trial, and Gil announces that he is going on sabbatical.Sweet Jane - The C.S.I. team doesn't know what to make of their new member ( Liev Schreiber), who joins them in the hunt for a serial killer, active since the 1970's.Redrum - Keppler proposes that Catherine create a phony crime scene to help catch a murderer, and to keep it secret from the other investigators. However, Nick quickly figures out that something is fishy.Meet Market - The discovery of a badly burned corpse uncovers a plot to illegally harvest bones and tissues, and the death of a middle-aged wife appears to be connected to her relationship with a high-priced male companion.Law Of Gravity - When one Trenton cop is murdered in Las Vegas, a second threatens to expose Keppler's past if he doesn't make the case and the evidence go away.Monster In The Box - Grissom thinks the miniature killer is dead, until he receives another miniature crime scene. However, unlike the others, this one predicts a crime scene that hasn't happened yet.Fallen Idols - A star high school basketball player disappears, and the investigation reveals that he gave an STD to a couple of his classmates.Empty Eyes - Six showgirls who live together are murdered in their home, and Sara is distressed when the final victim dies in her arms. However, she may have left Sara a vital clue that could help her ultimately identify the killer.Big Shots - A death in a drive-by limo shooting and the dragging death of a young woman turn out to be related crimes, and Greg discovers that the brother of the young man he ran over may have been involved.Lab Rats - With Grissom out of his office and all of the detectives out in the field, Hodges and the lab other techs try to discover new clues in the miniature killer case.Ending Happy - A washed-up boxer is found dead at a nearby bordello. There are several suspects, motives, and signs of injury. But the medical examiner is having a hard time figuring out which blow was the actual cause of death.Leapin' Lizzards - CSI discovers that a woman may have been murdered, and her head mounted on a wall as a trophy, because the killer was convinced that she was actually a powerful alien reptile. (Quite a bizzare episode and a bit of a departure from what you're used to seeing on CSI).The Good, The Bad And The Dominatrix - After an unsuccessful attempt on Lady Heather's life, Sara discovers Gil's prior relationship with her. Meanwhile, Nick investigates the death of a woman apparently hit by a taxicab.Living Doll - The miniature killer is ready to strike again, and Sara will be the next victim.

Because of the killer and what he/she has done to Sara, Grisolm ending up blurting out to the others about their relationship.

As the rest of the season unfolds, Greg (Eric Szmanda) finds himself in a predicament he never foresaw, Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) finds herself playing the role of victim, and when Grissom goes out of town, a shady transfered cop named Keppler (the excellent Liev Schreiber) arrives on the scene; culminating in one of the best storyarcs the series has ever seen.  As the season winds to a close, the CSI's close in on the miniature killer, and the season concludes with one of their lives in jeopardy, and the others desperate to make things right.

I wouldn't worry about any of that if while I were watching it I had enough emotional involvement to care if one of the characters died but after 3 seasons if a main character was killed off I'd just wonder how that would change the shows dynamics.One other thing that drive me a bit crazy is that the show acts like the FBI can't even use the bathroom without \"Charlies\" help. I understand its a tool to show how vital he is but he gets 911 calls and guilt trips from his brother before it's necessary, like at the very beginning of a case.So, while I recommend this show, especially for family viewing and believe it's well above average, I still can't say it's great.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Above average but still missing the mark", "unixReviewTime": 1269734400, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2010"},

They haven't been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras. I'd average that out to 2 stars for this set.Don't get me wrong--the first season was terrific for the most part. This set (like the first season set) features the moving \"The Man Who Was Never Born\" with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world. Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere (among his best), this was \"The Outer Limits\" as its best. Also we get \"The Galaxy Being\" with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death. David McCallum in \"The Sixth Finger\" about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how, in the process, we lose the essence of what makes us human.\"The Zanti Misfits\" like much of Stefano's work provides a neat allegory about human nature. We also get \"The Borderlands\" and many other classic episodes mixed with claptrap like \"Human Factor\" but almost everything here is terrific even if we're only getting half a season at a higher price than before.Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on \"The Outer Limits\"?

In August you can get the second half of the first season. I'm at a loss here--why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package?

Bala \"Me Too Can Read\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Dexter Morgan is good at his day job, that of a blood spatter analyst in Miami PD's forensics unit. But he's bloody brilliant at his other job, the one where he gets to murder. Whatever effed up sitch it was that caused Dexter's amnesia regarding his early childhood, it's left him dead inside, an empty shell, a calculating cold fish. He co-exists with something he calls a \"Dark Passenger,\" essentially this urge that compels him to kill and kill. Recognizing the predatory beast inside Dex, his ex-cop foster father, Harry (James Remar), took the boy under his wing, reoriented his twisted appetites to a more productive cause. He instilled in Dex an elaborate code of ethics, taught him to target only other serial killers. He taught Dexter how not to get caught, how to blend in. Dads are awesome. And Dexter has steadfastly abided by the Code of Harry. His kills have been righteous kills.This Showtime adaptation is based on Jeff Lindsay's riveting series of books, and if you haven't read them, well, what's the hold up? Dexter Morgan is so emotionally detached he makes Dr. Temperance Brennan seem positively warm and cuddly. Social cues to which we effortlessly respond are baffling puzzles for him. Perversely, there is something innately likable about Dexter. Michael C. Hall plays him with stunning complexity. It helps that, like in BURN NOTICE, we're privy to his inner musings. Dexter is often humorous and whimsical. The girlfriend (Julie Benz) he pretends to care for doesn't suspect a thing. Even Dexter's jittery, potty-mouthed cop sister, Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), doesn't have an inkling.DEXTER THE FIRST SEASON hooks you in straight away as Dexter finds his bragging rights as Miami's resident monster challenged by an innovative fellow serial killer whom the press eventually dubs the Ice Truck Killer. It's an edgy cat-and-mouse game that would span the entire season and cause Dexter to ask serious questions of himself. The lovely twist is that Dexter accepts the Ice Truck Killer's tauntings with glee, perhaps like calling to like. For Dexter, it's an opportunity to play with someone just like him. Never mind that it's readily apparent that this rival knows everything about Dexter Morgan. Dexter shrugs this off. He's having fun.The Ice Truck Killer's modus operandi is eye-catching. He drains his victims completely of their blood and he freezes the corpses, amputates their limbs to a precise measurement. It's fun - and creepy - watching Dexter try to contain his excitement as each perfect frozen body part surfaces, each bit a gauntlet thrown in Dexter's mug.Most each episode also features a \"serial killer of the week\" motif, some heinous repeat murderer targeted and eventually carved up by Dexter, and these lesser villains are required so that we don't lose faith in Dex as a badasss dude, given his inability to track down the elusive Ice Truck Killer. It's a pretty good supporting cast, too. It wasn't long before I was keen into what these other characters were up to. Jennifer Carpenter is my second favorite actor on this show. She is one sexy, combustible, never-stop-cussing cop chick. But I do question her instincts. She's Miami PD - an ex-Vice, newly minted Homicide Detective - and yet in all these years she hasn't caught a whiff of her adopted brother's true nature? And then she does something else which ends up absolutely mortifying. And then there's Erik King whose angry, loose cannon character, Sgt. Doakes, is the only one who gets the heebie jeebies from Dexter. Doakes bullies Dexter so much, I sort of wish Dexter would just disregard the Code of Harry for once. Except that Dexter remains as cool as the other side of the pillow. He's a monster who's got his priorities straight. You need to not miss this show. It's wicked funny, cleverly written, and terrifically acted (especially by Michael C. Hall). Rife with moral ambivalence, DEXTER rewards its audience with unexpected - and frequently unsettling - moments. And you're hooked before you know it.The DVD set's bonus features:- 2 Audio Commentaries by the Cast & Producers: \"Return to Sender\" (with Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, and Erik King) and \"Born Free\" (with producers Sara Coleton, Clyde Philips, & Daniel Cerone)- \"The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course\"- \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" - feature on a real-life police investigation in 2001 with particulars on blood spatter analysis- 2 Free Episodes of Showtime's Hit series BROTHERHOOD- A computer-compatible function which allows you to stream two episodes of THE TUDORS, to read the First 2 Chapters of Jeff Lindsay's newest novel DEXTER IN THE DARK, and play the newest CSI Video Game \"CSI: HARD EVIDENCE\"- Cast Biographies", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"Another beautiful Miami day.

{"reviewerID": "A3UDYY6L2NH3JS", "asin": "B000JO9JHW", "reviewerName": "Jacques COULARDEAU \"A soul doctor, so to say\"", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "This concerns only the first season of this series and I know some of the things will not seem right to those who have watched the next seasons. But that is just the point. The first season has characteristics that will change later and the meaning will change too. I will keep within the very limits of that first season. What we gather from the first episodes is that this blood technician working for the Miami PD is the adopted son of a police officer. He was adopted at the age of four by this police officer because he had been traumatized by the killing of his mother with a chain saw by some drug dealers. At once the series insists on the fact that this trauma caused an irreversible damage in the psyche of the child who is fascinated by death and needs killing just like junkies need their drugs. He is addicted to inflicting death to other people. We will only learn quite late in this season who his real father was, after his death actually, so we will never know the man really. We will not be given in this season any detail about the death of the mother beyond what I have said. And all the detail that comes up now and then is always flashbacks in the memory of the child that Dexter was. Dexter recovers that memory little by little just like any child or even adult would do in the case of a traumatic event. His foster father just tried to bring this death impulse of his within some acceptable limits, within a certain code: you can kill but to survive hence you have to kill people who are just plain dirty (I sort of remember this is the code of Anne Rice's vampires). And that's what he has been taught and trained to do. First hide your impulse. Second pick the proper criminals. Third do it so professionally that you can never be suspected. This ideology then is very typical. You can survive any trauma if you know what you are, if you accept what you are and if you find out why you are what your are. When you finally know, then you are clear. The term comes from Hubbard but it is the one that is needed here. It may change later. This concept of clarity is doubled then with the Skinnerian concept of absolute determination of your whole being and future by the mould into which you have been cast in the very first years of your life. In this case, Dexter is a killer because of his trauma that happened when he was four, hence he will be a killer all his life. No one can change that. One can only teach the kid a code, a method, an art to do things along a certain ethical line and not to be caught. That is pessimistic but that is not the main interest of this first season. The main interest is that another serial killer, the Ice Truck Killer, though not being a copy cat, is obviously aiming at this Dexter. And his crimes that are very special in their style, method and delivery are there to titillate Dexter, to chase or bait Dexter into a trap or a corner. Little by little we will learn the connection between the two and that I won't reveal. In the end Dexter will have the upper hand and kill his competitor, along his own method, more or less.  The second interest of this series is how Dexter can keep his secret for himself in his own private life, hiding it from the women he is going along with, from his own sister (foster sister for sure but sister anyway), from his direct colleagues, from his department, etc. It is subtle and difficult and there the actor is doing quite a good job, though the series is more building the meaning with the environment of the character than with the acting of the actor. As usual in American series the actors are rather static and the stage director, the series director and the set designer are building around him or her a composed visual moving environment that builds the meaning of the expression or speech of the actor. Note in this case most of the discourse of the main actor is his own voice over the pictures. He is telling us a story and it is often a commentary of what we can see. The next and essential quality of this series is of course the real artistic and artful suspense that is built in each episode and in the twelve episodes of the season and that lets us absolutely breathless most of the time, even when we finally know who the Ice Truck Killer is, and then the suspense does not go down one iota. In other words this series is so far, first season only, Dionysian, quick, fast, dense, exhilarating, inebriating, intoxicating and many other things of that sort. In one word it is addictive and habit forming. You may, if you have ten hours and a half at your disposal watch the twelve episodes in one go and you will never be bored, tired, de-concentrated.

I've heard people rant and rave for years about having so many channels and nothing to watch on TV. And then I started looking at two things. The first was my television watching schedule which has actually begun cutting into my DVD watching schedule (so little time, so much to watch). Then I looked at my shelving unit and noticed the number of TV series collections there. People are wrong. There is plenty good to watch on TV. And DEXTER is an example of it.For those who aren't aware, DEXTER is a series on Showtime, so many of you might not have seen it. If that's the case you're in luck because the series has been released on DVD. While season two has just hit shelves in blu-ray format, the focus here is season one.Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. His job is to help collect and understand evidence found at the scene of a crime that involves blood and blood splatter patterns. Oh, and on the side, Dexter is a serial killer.Stay with me here because he's not a bad guy really. Well...then again maybe he is. After all he is a murderer multiple times over. The difference is that Dexter only kills bad guys. Dexter kills murderers, pedophiles, arsonists and the like that got off due to some technicality. But he always verifies that they were guilty before taking them out of the picture.Dexter's foster father Harry (James Remar) was a police man who found Dexter at the scene of a crime before adopting him. Harry recognized the killing instinct found in Dexter at an early age so he helped him to channel that, to use rules that he established for Dexter, to get through life. And via Harry's rules, Dexter now kills bad guys using his job as a means to find just the right victims.So there is the basic set up for the series. But it's so much more than that, filled with layer upon layer of subtext and inner meaning that is revealed as the series progresses.Season one focuses first on letting us know who Dexter is and who the surrounding cast of characters involved with him are. First off is his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), a seemingly spastic patrol officer dying to become a homicide detective. Deb's enthusiasm for the job is off set by her self deprecating ways and the giddiness she exhibits for all things.At the stations there are two main characters who affect Dexter. The first is Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) his direct supervisor who at times seems to have a personal interest in Dexter. A woman who's made it where she is by hard work, she has a storyline of her own involving police office politics as the series progresses.The second is Sgt. James Doakes (Eric King), Dexter's apparent nemesis. Doakes is a hard boiled cop from top to bottom, a no nonsense sort who wants answer and wants them now. Doakes is constantly badgering Dexter, offering everything from name calling to in your face attitude. One would think that eventually the two of them would reach a point where there wouldn't be room for both of them in Miami. One would think.Along with these major players there is an assortment of cast members in the squad who round out the ensemble in the best way possible. And each gets enough screen time in season one to make them a character to care about. The interaction between them on a personal level comes into play as the layers of Dexter unravel.On the personal side, Dexter actually has a girlfriend. Normal on the outside, but not within. It seems Dexter has taken her as his girlfriend to help appear normal. It is through his thoughts (voice over into Dexter's mind runs throughout the series) concerning her that he lets us know he is devoid of emotion, that he has no feelings. His involvement with her is purely as a means to offer him cover.Rita (Julie Bienz) is a battered wife, or at least she was. Dexter's sister was on call when her ex was arrested. Paul, her ex, was a wife beater extreme and a drug user to boot. Now in prison, he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family's life crosses Dexter's life as well.With characters and plot lines established, you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do. Instead, Dexter finds himself in a competition of sorts when a new serial killer hits Miami. And this killer is leaving calling cards that Dexter not only finds discomforting but amazing as well. He's impressed with the style and artistic ability of the killer who leaves his victims in pieces and drained of blood.As each episode continues the tale, we find that this new killer referred to as the Ice Truck Killer (when it's discovered that he uses one to haul victims from their murder location to where he leaves their bodies) knows something about Dexter. He leaves small clues at first for Dexter to find. Eventually he leaves Polaroid's of Dexter's past as well. It seems that the perfect serial killer is being stalked by his own serial killer.Season one not only defines who the character of Dexter is it offers the world he lives in and tosses in his biggest match to boot. How Dexter became who he is and what influences him is told in flashback. His motivations are shown by the end of this season as is the identity of the Ice Truck Killer. But will that change who Dexter is? Doubtful since season four begins soon.What makes this show so unique is that it combines one of the most frightening characters one can imagine, a soul less who cares serial killer, with one of the wittiest funny line spouting people seen on TV. Dexter tosses off subtle one liners non-stop and each one offers a glimpse behind the mask and a laugh as well.But the amazing thing is that not only do we find ourselves repulsed and attracted to the same character, we find in the writing that there is more to him than is even he realizes. The character of Dexter may think he possesses no emotions whatsoever but his emotions run deeper than he realizes. And it seems as though his journey of self revelation may be what's driving the series forward in later seasons.Also Dexter offers something that many of us would never want to admit we seek. An avenging angel out there doing what so many would love to know is going on but at the same time turn their head and condemn on the outside. Like Jack Bauer of \"24\", a hero who uses tactics we claim to hate while hoping someone like him exists to protect us, Dexter is the privately admired solution for those who feel that the worst of criminals are let lose on technicalities. We would fear someone like Dexter while at the same time would love to see someone who doesn't let the bad guy get away with murder. Even though this is what Dexter does, murder.There is no way to offer up in this short space just what it is that Dexter is about. Police procedural. Police politics. Serial killer. Murder mystery. Family complexities. Killing tutorial. Hilarious dark comedy. All are a part of Dexter and all come together in a fantastic package.If you're not afraid to try something a little different, then you need to give Dexter a try. I know the season one set I watch belonged to my son. After watching I intend to get a copy of my own. And to continue with it down the line. I'm already hard at work watching season two on blu-ray to write about. Unusual, quirky, off beat, scary, normal...all are words that define Dexter. And yet none can explain what this series is all about. Watch and see.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "AM I WRONG FOR LOVING THIS SHOW?", "unixReviewTime": 1242604800, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2009"},

I finally watched my very first episode of \"Dexter\" last weekend, and I ended up finishing Season 1 in its entirety within a few days. This is an amazing show about Dexter (Michael C. Hall), a Miami-based forensics experts who also happens to be a serial killer. However, Dexter is a NICE serial killer in that he has a strict moral code that he always adheres to: He only kills people who are violent criminals themselves and deserve to be punished. The first season of \"Dexter\" revolves around another serial killer that's been terrorizing the state of Florida. The Ice Truck Killer has a nasty habit of murdering prostitutes, cutting them up into pieces, and arranging their bodies artfully in very public places. Dexter works with members of the police department, including his adopted sister, Deb (Jennifer Carter), to find the killer. However, Dexter can't help being fascinated by the Ice Truck Killer's meticulous technique. He soon begins communicating with the killer, who seems to have an uncanny connection to Dexter and starts using his murders to trigger painful, repressed memories from Dexter's past.I became hooked on this show very quickly. Hall is amazing as Dexter, who is probably one of the most complex characters in television history. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Carter, Erik King as Sergeant Doakes (the only person who suspects Dexter of any wrongdoing), and James Remar, who portrays Dexter's father in flashbacks. I'm not particularly fond of Rita's character (portrayed by Julie Benz). She's incredibly wishy-washy, but I can definitely see why Dexter was drawn to someone with her personality. I also think the whole Ice Truck Killer identity revelation, intriguing as it was, could have been a bit less obvious. (I figured out his real identity and true connection to Dexter right away, so either the story was a bit too predictable or I am just incredibly brilliant.)Overall, though, \"Dexter\" is a very unique and compelling show.

Tresca \"Talien\"", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "Sometimes I find connections to Hollywood in the strangest places.  In the case of Dexter, it was at my day job. Now my office job is not normally the place one associates with a show like Dexter, but it turns out that the sister of the guy I worked with worked on the show. The fact that the show is on Showtime and thus can portray gore and violence as appropriate to the medium (like HBO's Rome, for example) piqued my curiosity. Unfortunately, it took me over a year to actually view season one.  I'm sorry I waited so long.I've done enough research on serial killers (and their fictional cousin, slashers) to know that they're easy to mess up.  And an entire season about a serial killer from the serial killer's perspective is fraught with peril. Fortunately, Dexter hits all the right notes to keep an audience engaged for the entire season.Dexter Mogran (Michael C. Hall) is a serial killer with a cause.  His father, Harry (James Remar) recognized his adopted son's homicidal tendencies and trained him to stalk the most despicable of prey.  These were the lowest of the low, the scum that Harry in his job as a cop saw frequently escape justice.  Dexter became a Final Solution of sorts, eliminating people neatly and efficiently while at the same time fulfilling insatiable desire for bloodshed.  Literally.In his day job, Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.  He works side-by-side with his adopted sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), probably the most annoying character in the show.  And yet, she's annoying on purpose - her frail, waif-like reactions to men and the rigors of her job make her alternately pathetic and vulnerable, feral and misguided.  In short, she needs Dexter's calm, creepy presence. Rounding out the cast is career-climbing Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez), coworkers Angel Batista (David Zayas) and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee, formerly of the show Chuck) and my favorite character, foul-mouthed Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King).  Doakes is the only person who sees Dexter for what he is, but he can't prove it.Dexter feigns a personal life as well.  He has a girlfriend, Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), whose last relationship was so emotionally scarring that she fears intimacy, which suits Dexter just fine.  Indeed, all of Dexter's life is an act, from the jokes he cracks to the donuts he brings to the pleasantries he exchanges with Rita.  He's a monster masquerading as a person, and the only reason it's not more obvious is because everyone else has more pressing problems.Dexter's job puts him in a unique position to both appreciate the art of the kill and find new victims. Despite his penchant for murdering his victims, Dexter's murders are relatively clean - he drains his victims of blood, hacks the pieces up, and tosses them into the ocean.  And so it goes: find some sleazeball who escaped justice, kidnap him or her, murder, dump the body, repeat. Until one day, another serial killer who seems to know intimate details about Dexter's past begins sending messages through his own unique style of doll-like murders.The ending of season one won't be a shock to observant viewers.  It's not the actual ending that matters but the journey getting there. Dexter's narration is amusing and wry, his cadence just off enough that he comes across as disturbed yet functional. Surprisingly, the show isn't very gory at all.  Dexter would probably be less sympathetic if we were subjected to every grisly detail.  In fact, by cutting away from the most gruesome scenes, Dexter has to remind us that he's one of the bad guys - the Code of Harry is as much the anti-hero's code that we see in a multitude of other crime-fighting shows.  It's a credit to the writers that Dexter is both a monstrous, damaged human being and yet still human.Can't wait for season two!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Dexter Gets it Right", "unixReviewTime": 1209254400, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2008"},

Besides some relatively small BD-Live features (including seeing the first episode the third season), there really isn't anything here that wasn't on the standard-def version of the Complete First Season, but for Blu-Ray owners who haven't taken the plunge into Dexter's world, this is definitely worth checking out.  Below is my original review for first season.The interesting concept of this Showtime series makes it reason enough to check it out.  Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under) plays the title character, who works in forensics for the Florida police by day, and is a serial killer at night. Because of his job and upbringing by a police officer foster father (James Remar), Dexter knows how to cover his tracks while wearing his mask of humanity by day.  Slowly though, things start to take a turn when another serial killer with connections to Dexter's own mysterious past rears his head, and soon enough our title character is caught in a bloody game of cat and mouse.  What makes Dexter so good is the approach taken to the theme of the series by the creators and Hall himself.  What could have easily flopped and failed miserably instead evolves episode by episode as we attempt to see what makes Dexter tick.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well to say the least. Julie Benz (the vampiric Darla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) is superb as Rita: Dexter's rape victim girlfriend whom he keeps around so he doesn't have to bother with sex, HBO's Oz veterans Lauren Velez and David Zayas as fellow cops, and hottie Jennifer Carpenter (whom Hall has recently married, seriously) as Dexter's sister.

The premise if phenomenal...Dexter is a blood-spatter expert investigating murders by day and a murdered of killers by night.  By channeling his impulses to kill in a \"helpful\" way...he is actually a hero.  I know, I know, anyone who kills is bad...but seriously, the people Dexter knocks off are mostly brutal serial-killers themselves...killers who knock off children and other innocents.  Dexter is doing the world a favor.  And that's the problem...he is so meticulous in who he kills that his dark side is really never more than a naughty wink.  There's no real ethical dilemma for the viewer in rooting for Dexter.But don't get me wrong...the show is a blast nonetheless.  From it's super-saturated Florida colors, to its sly & witty narration, the show is top-notch and very entertaining.  Michael C. Hall is perfect as DEXTER.  While his performance isn't exactly a tour-de-force of evil (like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for example)...it is a lovely, inventive performance.  He brings nuance to the role of a guy who has to fake smiling...and because we know he's faking, we're kinda in on the joke.  We can be \"amused\" along with Dexter at his ability to fool most of society into liking him.The only true \"dark side\" to Dexter is his inability to love.  He has a girlfriend, but only to help himself look normal.  He is very good to her and her kids, and the poor girl (damaged from a previous, abusive marriage) just adores Dexter in return.  But he doesn't really have feelings for her, and this colors all their scenes together.  This is the ethical quandary that I wish Dexter's killings also had.The other thing I really like about the show are the flashbacks, showing Dexter being raised and groomed for his work by a very understanding foster father, who happens to be a cop.  James Remar plays this part so well...it's probably the best role this long-time character actor has ever had.  It's a small part, but he brings great strength to it.  And great love and concern for Dexter.  You always hear that parents will do ANYTHING to protect their kids...Remar's character is the ultimate example of this.Also, the opening credits of the show are AWESOME!!  Creepy and clever.So, while the show, to me, isn't perfect (I would prefer it a little darker), it is still HUGELY entertaining, well-acted by its lead and well-filmed for a relatively low budget.

You ALMOST feel bad for the guy for the hand he's been dealt, and SOMEWHAT admirable for the way he's made lemonade out of his life's lemons.This show couldn't exist on network TV, and like many other \"rawer\" shows, needs a lot of room to run.

Depending on how you look at it, Dexter is either a hero who rids society of reprehensible, murderous villains, or an elusive criminal whose killing rampage must be stopped.  One thing, however, is certain.  Dexter is very cool, and is unlike any character on television.  Hall heads a fine cast in a sort of \"Law and Order\" series with a touch of the Grand Guignol.

{"reviewerID": "A6VXZ1EEPRTLV", "asin": "B000JO9JHW", "reviewerName": "trebe", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "A Showtime production, Dexter is an anomaly.  It is a brilliantly written, intriguing, and totally engrossing series, that is seldom predictable.  Besides a compelling storyline, and characters that seem real, what makes the series even more unique, is that the protagonist, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter expert for the Miami police, is a cold blooded murderer.Hall's unusual role is the key to the series, and his performance is a riveting, and captivating character study, that makes Dexter a very hard show to turn away from.  Morgan is guided by the `Code of Harry'.  Harry (James Remar) was Dexter's adoptive father, an ex-cop who recognized that his traumatized son, had homicidal tendencies.  To help him survive, Harry trained Dexter to channel his desire to kill in a 'positive' direction, by instilling the directive to kill only those who truly deserve to die.  This twisted morality is quite bizarre, and makes for fascinating viewing, as Dexter kills ceremoniously.Presumably to contain any spilled blood, plastic sheeting is typically spread all around the area, and Dexter himself is also covered with plastic sheeting.  Victims are taped down naked to a table top face up, helpless and unable to move.  After drawing a blood sample for his collection, Dexter gets to work.  The dead body is chopped into pieces, and the remains placed in trash bags.  Few of the grisly details are actually shown, but the presentation is still pretty chilling.  The series has a wicked sense of humor, as Dexter discusses his thoughts through narration, as he nonchalantly goes about his business, which includes murder.  Harry is dead, but appears frequently, in flashbacks.  Harry's biological daughter Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), also works for the Miami PD in homicide.  She is eager, enthusiastic, loves to swear, and has a problem with authority.The twelve episodes play like a chapters in a book.  Unlike most weekly series, the format does not always involve solving a particular case within the episode.  Instead, the story unfolds broadly and more naturally, with information about Dexter and his past, coming in small bits.  Dexter is dealing with coming to terms with his emotions, or lack thereof, and watching how this affects the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz), is fascinating.  Benz's performance is pretty amazing, playing an abused woman trying to start a new relationship.The central underlying story concerns a serial killer known as `Ice Truck Killer', who specializes in neatly slicing up his victim's bodies into bloodless pieces.  The whole concept is diabolically macabre, and well executed.  The killer has taken a special interest in Dexter, and tension and suspense grows more intense, after the killer's identity is revealed with a few episodes left to go.  The killer has an elaborate plan, though he is forced to improvise when the pursuit begins to close in.  As Dexter begins to recall the horrific circumstances surrounding his mother's death, the killer makes his play.  The writing is outstanding, and keeps you off balance.  Approaching the conclusion, things get a little shaky in the turn, but control is reacquired, and Dexter finishes wildly and dramatically, with a stylistic flourish that does not cheat the viewer.Dexter is refreshingly different from most forensic procedurals.  Although dealing with violence and death, there isn't a lot of fighting, shootouts, or chases.  The focus is on character and story development.  While there are things that go over the top, or are illogical, unlike programs like the CSI franchise, the level of drama isn't routinely pumped up by threats, flashy violence, condescending dialog, or music.  The police in Dexter work `normally', with no overly dramatic background music, while routine tasks like, processing the crime scene, performing tests, or analyzing evidence take place.  The level of acting by almost everyone involved is excellent, from the minor characters to the leads.  The writing is not perfect, but the characters and their dialog, are mostly credible, showing the audience some respect.  There are no long winded pretentious speeches sprouting psychobabble, phony overdramatic situations, and characters trying to top each other, or engaging in supercop behavior.  Criminal Minds or CSI Miami, this is not.The series is far from perfect, and doesn't escape being ridiculous.  While a darkened room, draped with plastic sheeting, with a naked victim tapped down helpless, is a terrifying scene, it makes little sense, unless Dexter has giant rolls of plastic sheeting, and maybe a case of packing tape in his car.  The time it would take to actually prepare the scene, and put up all that sheeting would be ridiculous.  Tape and plastic sheeting are excellent for retaining evidence like fingerprints, would have to be destroyed.  Dexter disposes a couple of bags of body parts per kill, but what happens to all that tape and plastic sheeting?  Over the course of the season, Dexter takes chances, makes mistakes, and has several close calls, and is clearly under suspicion, at the conclusion, setting the stage for the next season.One of the few negatives is the lack of subtitles, and the inappropriateness of the extras.  Two episodes have commentary tracks, but some of the other bonus materials, are not directly related to the series.  The mini-documentary Witnessed in Blood, covers the forensics for an unrelated criminal case.  And two episodes of Showtime's series Brotherhood are included, presumably as an attempt to promote that series.  More material specifically relevant to Dexter, would certainly have been preferred.  Otherwise, needless to say, the series is highly recommended to fans of the forensic crime genre.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "the rarest of programs, Dexter actually lives up to the hype . . . and may drain the blood from your extremities . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1261008000, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2009"},

Michael C. Hall (\"Six Feet Under\") plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his \"urges\" and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It's a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn't an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it's kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama \"Brotherhood\". We also get \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to \"Dexter\" because that's what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven't listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series \"The Tudors\" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that \"The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course\" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won't be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn't indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter's father a police officer recognized early on his son's proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his \"skills\" to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he's not normal and he also knows he doesn't fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something \"better\".When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move.

Kind of a twisted play on Freud's concept of sublimation.  The series didn't initially appeal to me, but overall I'm pleased that I stuck with the first season.  Michael C. Hall plays the titular character, a forensic expert in blood splatter.  He works alongside a group of detectives assigned to some of most brutal Miami murders; one of these cops is Dexter's adopted sister, Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter).  Dexter was adopted as a child by a Miami cop (the now deceased Harry Morgan) who recognized that Dexter was antisocial.  Instead of allowing Dexter to go down the path of juvenile delinquency (and inevitably murder), Harry developed a code for him - you can kill but only under certain circumstances.  Harry also encouraged Dexter to do things to make him seem normal, such as dating, to help him hide his true nature and go undetected.  Most episodes feature Dexter stalking a serial killer, with a season long plot involving Dexter's fascination with the \"Ice Truck Killer.\"The series features excellent writing and direction, which helps make the somewhat unbelievable premise feel realistic.  The acting also is top-notch.  Hall does a nice job of making Dexter charming and likeable (so that we can believe that he can fit in at work and his relationships) while also adding a bit of edge through his lack of true emotion, superficial charm, and violent impulses.  We can sense that evil lurks just below the surface, kept in check only by his adherence to his code.  It's a solid portrayal of an extreme case of antisocial personality disorder, and the series isn't afraid to make its protagonist dark and somewhat frightening.  The supporting cast is also terrific, with C.S. Lee scoring as Vince Masuka, Dexter's lascivious co-worker who is a walking sexual harassment case.  Likewise, Sgt. Doakes (Erik King) helps lighten the mood as the only person who seems to know that Dexter is not the good guy he portrays.  I also enjoy the work of two \"Oz\" veterans - Lauren Velez as Dexter's complicated Lieutenant, and David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista (perhaps Dexter's closest \"friend\").Although I enjoyed the show, there were a few things I disliked about the first season.  Debra's insecurity is highly grating, and the actress gives a twitchy, affected performance.  Dexter's flashbacks to his days with Harry become extremely repetitive and unrealistic after awhile.  The first few episodes were difficult to watch, and Dexter came across as quite brutal; I was ready to give up on the series after these shows, but the character became more \"human\" in subsequent episodes.  Finally, the last two episodes of the season, which focused on the Ice Truck Killer case, were overly melodramatic and lead to a rather unsatisfying ending.  Although I approached the series with some trepidation and found it flawed, there's enough to like about the Season 1 that I plan on watching Season 2 on DVD.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Extreme Dexter-ity", "unixReviewTime": 1250380800, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2009"},

Fancy come to explosive blows after a long, slow simmer, imagine what happens immediately after Kavanaugh asks Mackey in a rage-filled voice \"Are you happy NOW...Detective Mackey?\" There was a strong undercurrent of racial tensions between the NYPD Blue characters, which led (in a large part) to them both reaching the breaking point, but Mackey and Kavanaugh are not at odds with each other because of their ethnicity. Over the course of the entire season, the subject is never approached and it is not a relevant detail in the conflict. They're two men who began with the right motives and slowly let their circumstances determine their mission. There are mixed opinions surrounding the Glenn Close \"Capt. Rawling\" story arc experiment from Season 4. In a few short days, Whitaker is back for a second season as Kavanaugh, and the events of Season 5 were grounded more in risk taking than stunt scripting. The Shield is a brutal, intensely creative show with one of the best casts and creative teams on TV. By creating synergy with the events laid out in the pilot episode (and multiple references in the \"extras\" portion of the set to \"Shakespearean\" drama), it's clear that this series aims very, very high and more often than not hits the target.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"Are you happy NOW...Detective Mackey?\"", "unixReviewTime": 1175385600, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2007"},

Corrupt cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and his Strike team are back together again, Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson) is in prison, Rawling is gone, Aceveda (Benito Martinez) seems out of reach; it seems like it's business as usual.  Then everything changes.  Enter Forest Whitaker as Jon Kavanaugh, an IAD lieutenant who is making it his sole purpose in life to bring Vic down.  His method: using Lem (Kenny Johnson) as a blackmail tactic to rat out Vic.  But as we learn as the season progresses, not only do things not go as planned, but everything comes to a shocker of a conclusion that will have you beating the walls in anticipation for the sixth season.  Also going on during the season are a variety of things: Julian (Michael Jace) breaks in a new partner (Paula Garces) because Danny (Catherine Dent) is pregnant, Wyms (CCH Pounder) looks to take another shot at being the Captain, and Shane (Walt Goggins) makes a choice that will alter the course of the show forever.

After Mackey killed Terry Crowley during the first season of \"The Shield\" karma was going to catch up with him sooner than later and now the Strike Team is under I.A.D. investigation by Jon Kavanaugh (Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker). Mackey seemed on the road to redemption during the fourth season when the new captain (Glenn Close)gave him the chance to reassemble his team and make a difference in the Farmington police district. The investigation that she instigated which was designed to exonerate members of her team has turned into crusade where Kavanaugh will use any and all teams to bring down Mackey and his team.By the fifth season of \"The Shield\" I was afraid the show would jump the shark--in fact it has done anything but that with writing that is still among the best on TV with morally complex characters sporting shades of gray to their personalities vs. being simple black and white caricatures of good guys and bad guys. Chiklis proves as he has over the last four seasons to be one of the best actors on TV with his complex portrayal of Mackey. Chiklis though wouldn't be where he is without the terrific supporting cast. During the fifth season Mackey's nemesis begins to resemble him as he tries to bring down Mackey and his team. Mackey may be morally corrupt person but there is still a decent person buried somewhere within his soul which allows fans of the series to be rooting for him even if he is often the bad guy (hey, he killed a cop in the first episode of the first season!).The show looks grainy and dark which benefits the cinema verite/documentary look of the show with its handheld cameras and unexpected pans. As always Dutch(Jay Karnes) and Claudette (CCH Pounder)continue to be the moral center and conscience of the show and as fascinating as Mackey and his team are, these two detectives are equally as fascinating as they bring down a serial killer with perfect alibies and other difficult to crack cases. The politically astute former Captain of the station David Aceveda (Benito Martinez)continues to have a darkness to his \"moral\" character particularly after the physical assualt at the hands of an ex-con that occurred during the third season.The DVD has some great special features including commentary tracks with a nice mix of cast members, a featurette on the productio of the fifth season, a tribute to executive producer/director Scott Brazil who died during the sixth season and a Q&A; session with Chiklis, producer/writer/creator Shawn Ryan and Forrest Whitaker discussing their characters and the development of the series. We also get deleted scenes as well as the sixth season \"prequel\" that sets up season six.The seventh season (which will air this spring)is reportedly the last season for the show so if you've caught the bug for \"The Shield\" but fallen behind in watching the show, now you can spent time either catching the reruns or watching the DVDs in plenty of time for season seven.Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Mackey almost meets his match in Kavanaugh", "unixReviewTime": 1183680000, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2007"},

{"reviewerID": "A3N6GAJTEOF4MO", "asin": "B000LVIIUC", "reviewerName": "Caleb Williams", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "With season 10 the South Park creators set out to give us something that would challenge the creators of Family Guy and would set out in challenging those who like the Family Guy comedy. They also set out in making a point about the whole showing an image of the Prophet Muhammad on national TV, they set out in making a point about freedom of expression and not allowing terror threats to scare them. Did they win that war? You'll have to watch this season to find out.Episode 1: The Return of Chef: In this episode we see Chef return to South Park after a time with the Super Adventure Club who we later learn that they are a group of explorers that show a special interest in the children of remote tribes. The boys have to cope with this change in Chef and the influence that the Super Adventure Club had on him. In reality this is the episode where we say goodbye to Chef for good, as in season 9 South Park had an episode called Trapped in the Closet which made fun of the \"Religion\" of Scientology. Isaac Hayes who was the voice of Chef is a Scientologist, he seemed to hold a double standard when making fun of religion. It's OK to make fun of Christianity, Judaism, Mormonism etc but as long as you don't make fun of Scientology it's OK but if you do then Hayes said goodbye to South Park. This is an amazing episode and is really enjoyable listening to Chef speak as it's chopped together dialogue from previous episodes.Episode 2: Smug Alert: \"I know, for this episode let's make fun of those people who drive environmentally friendly cars and suddenly think they're better than everybody else.\" This is what Stone & Parker would have thought when coming up with the idea for this episode as they do just that. They pick up on the smugness of these people and tear them apart which is a very intelligent move by the creators. The story is simple; Gerald, Kyles dad is now the owner of a hybrid car and he suddenly feels it's his duty to insult those who have gas gusler cars. Gerald moves the family to San Francisco where everybody drives a Hybrid, but Stan being upset with this decides to write a song that will encourage more people to buy Hybrids which should get Kyle to come back home. This is a great episode with a great message about those people who to drive the hybrid cars, it takes the subject and says to those people \"I know you drive them, and I don't care.\"Episode 3 & 4: Cartoon Wars Part 1 & 2: This is an episode that stirred up a lot of controversy as these two episodes were based around the whole image of Muhammad hysteria that was surrounding the media at the time. Stone & Parker had made the episodes with the clear intention of Comedy Central showing the image on TV and setting an example about freedom of speech but unfortunately it wasn't to be. The story of the episodes are that Family Guy are set to show an image of Muhammad in one of their episodes; Cartman being utterly offended by this sets out to put an end to Family Guy once and for all but he has one obstacle; Kyle. These are a great set of episodes that just rip Family Guy to pieces when talking about their comedy, the whole notion of Family Guy being written my Manatees is brilliant and when you really give it some thought you start to think to yourself, \"Well maybe this is possible.\"Episode 5: A Million Little Fibers: This is by far the weakest episode of the bunch as it's an episode focusing directly on Towelie. He decides to write a book about his life but everything keeps going wrong and he can't get his book published because he's a towel. He assumes a human personality and changes his book around which becomes an instant success and Oprah Winfrey wants to put her name on this book. This is really one of the weakest episodes out of them all and I think was just a filler to get to the next great idea.Episode 6: Manbearpig: This is the typical insult episode that rips apart Al Gore over the movie he made called an Inconvenient Truth, it makes fun of the whole \"Look at me I'm an ex-president trying to keep the limelight\" that seems to surround Al Gore. He has a new theory in South Park and that's a monster that will be a danger to everyone, Manbearpig. Half man, half bear and half pig, he can't prove it but he's super serial.Episode 7: Tsst: I honestly don't think I've ever laughed so much at a South Park episode, Cesar Milan of the Dog Whisperer fame is called in to take control of Cartman and his bad behaviour. Using some techniques that would only usually be performed on Dogs, Cartman isn't happy about being humiliated and resorts to making some drastic plans for revenge.Episode 8: Make Love, Not Warcraft: Everybody has them, everybody has that one friend who would quite openly admit that they would rather spend the day on World of Warcraft than go outside and play. Parker and Stone set out to make fun of these kids and show them that they need to get out more, some people may find it harsh but some people like myself would find it utterly hysterical.Episode 9: Mystery of the Urinal Deuce: The world's biggest conspiracy of all time will finally be uncovered when Eric Cartman exposes the true culprit behind the September 11th attacks. How will that person prove his innocence and who really was behind 9/11. This is a funny episode that gives a big slap in the face of the conspiracy theorists, I can't help but think that Parker and Stone wanted to give their opinions on the subject in this episode rather than just be intelligent about it.Episode 10: Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy: Eric Cartman is selected to become South Park elementary schools hall monitor, so he dons the look of a bounty hunter and sets out to clean up the halls. He accidentally stumbles upon a teacher in a relationship with a student and wants to put a stop to it. A very good episode with some strong home truths.Episode 11: Hell On Earth 2006: Satan is throwing the biggest Halloween costume party ever, and no one will be admitted without a wristband. Every detail must be perfect for the prince of darkness. But even Satan can't foresee everything. A prominent religious organization, an ex-lover and the antics of the most notorious serial killers of all time threaten Satan's fun. A complete slaughtering of the my Super Sweet 16 girls which I personally feel was long overdue from the South Park guys.Episode 12: Go God Go Part 1: South Park Elementary faces strong opposition to the topic of evolution being taught to the 4th graders. The most vocal protests are from Ms. Garrison who has to teach it. Eric Cartman can't be bothered with what's going on in class. He's busy manipulating his own personal time-line to align with the precise release date of the Nintendo Wii. A great satirical episode that this time doesn't poke fun at the notion of religion but pokes fun at a world without religion, would we all really get along like Richard Dawkins says we would?Episode 13: Go God Go Part 2: Last week Eric Cartman froze himself in an attempt to make his three-week wait for a hot, new, gaming device pass quickly. A freak accident landed him over 500 years in the future and now he's stuck there. The future is a tumultuous place with warring factions, angry sea otters and no Nintendo. Will Cartman find a way back to his own time? A humorous look on a future without religion, how would we find a way to keep fighting if we don't have the excuse of religion.Episode 14: Stanley's Cup: Stan Marsh has hit rock bottom. He's got no job, no bicycle and his only way out of a bad situation, is to coach the local pee wee hockey team. Once a hotshot pee wee hockey player himself, Stan Marsh has tried to put those days behind him. But he's still living with the memory of how let his team down when he missed the winning shot in the big game. Now, he's about to find out that being a coach means facing your past. He's determined to show his kids what it's like to be a winner! Personally I didn't understand this episode and it wasn't very good, the whole children having cancer thing I think was simply for shock value.A really good season with two 2 parters that would have you thinking and laughing at the same time which is a trademark of South Park.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "South Park Issues The Challenge To Family Guy", "unixReviewTime": 1214352000, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2008"},

The social/political satire is still as strong as ever but the episodes are stretching more to make their points.  Instead of being absurdly funny and clever, some of these episodes are just absurd and go out of their way to say, \"Look at me, look how shocking I am\" (\"The Return of Chef,\" \"Smug Alert!,\" \"A Million Little Fibers,\" \"Stanley's Cup\").  Still, this season offers what I believe is the greatest SP episode of all-time and maybe the best thing I have ever seen on television: \"Make Love Not Warcraft.\"  This episode is so well-done in animation (yes, excellent SP animation) and story-writing that I cannot praise it enough.  Plus, it includes music from one of my favorite singers ever: Paul Stanley!  Then there are the excellent two-parters when Cartman goes to the future (Mrs. Garrison and that scholar guy are hilarious!) and  \"Cartoon Wars\" where SP takes on Family Guy with references to other animated shows. \"Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy\" takes the female teacher/boy student love affair controversy to a level only SP can. The positives outweight the negatives here but it's not perfect, so I can't give it 5 stars no matter how much I love the World of Warcraft episode. The cover of the box (Target edition) is awesome.  You see the SP boys fat and pimply and, by tilting the box, you see their World of Warcraft characters.Disc 1:\"The Return of Chef\"--Controversial episode that got back at Isaac Hayes for leaving SP when it tackled the Scientology issue. Hearing old Chef audio clips, the SP boys notice something has changed drastically in Chef after his return from an adventure with a mysterious club.  Yikes!\"Smug Alert!\"--People of SP start buying hybrid cars and find out they're threatening the planet with emissions of another kind.  The beginning of this episode with Gerald acting all high and mighty in his hybrid was great.  I thought it was going to be another excellent episode.  At the point where the forest ranger explains what's going on to Stan, things went downhill.  Here, the episode tried a little too hard to make a statement.  It is very contrived.\"Cartoon Wars Part 1\"--Fear engulfs SP when a Family Guy episode showing an image of Mohammad threatens holy war.  While the nation buries its head in the sand (literally), Cartman goes on a mission to cancel Family Guy and Kyle tries to stop him.\"Cartoon Wars Part 2\"--Pre-empted for a Terrance and Phillip television special...just kidding.  Cartman finds out something shocking about the writers of Family Guy.  I'll admit that show makes a lot more sense now.  The Muslims' retaliation was going in the right direction but ended up going the way of \"The Passion of the Jew\" which is unfortunate because it became stupid instead of funny.\"A Million Little Fibers\"--Towlie promotes his memoirs but hits a snatch...er...snag when he lies to Oprah Winfrey.  This episode is way over-the-top for my tastes and is not re-watchable.Disc 2:\"Manbearpig\"--Al Gore is super serial about a new threat to the planet.  Can the man who invented the Internet save the earth from the vicious Manbearpig? Wait...isn't manbearpig an endangered species?\"Tsst\"--Mrs. Cartman has had it with her out-of-control son but, after failing on several nanny reality shows, has to resort to hiring a dog trainer.  One of the better episodes of this season.\"Make Love Not Warcraft\"--The best thing I've seen on TV, period.  Brilliant! It's interesting that here is one of the few times Cartman is a good leader who isn't a jerk to everyone...except Butters, of course.\"The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce\"--An unwelcomed sight in the boy's room somehow leads to the unlocking of a 9/11 conspiracy.  We get to meet the Hardly Boys who seem to be hardly ever not hard.  The funniest part of this episode is how Mr. Mackey keeps hounding on finding more than a cake in the urinal.\"Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy\"--A teacher at SP Elementary is having an affair with a student...a very young student.  Meanwhile, Cartman gets some real \"authoritie\" as a hallway monitor and treats his job as if he is a certain television bounty hunter.  His assistant Beth with the big knockers is hilarious.Disc 3:\"Hell On Earth 2006\"--Satan wants a Halloween party just like the Super Sweet 16 parties those snotty rich girls on MTV get.  Meanwhile, the folks of SP keep summoning Biggie Smalls back to earth.  A ho-hum episode. The Three Stooges take-off with Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacey doesn't do it for me. It just doesn't make sense as Bundy would never hang out with those guys.  Plus, Gacey would want to kill children, not adults and Dahmer would be killing young, dark-skinned men.\"Go God Go\"--Mrs. Garrison is against teaching her class evolution until a handsome atheist scholar is hired to teach her class.  Meanwhile, Cartman can't wait for the release of the Nintendo Wii so he has himself frozen but his defrost took longer than he anticipated.  Tears came to my eyes when Mrs. Garrison described evolution to the class I was laughing so hard.\"Go God Go XII\"--Cartman is stuck in the future where there is no religion and, therefore, no war...yeah right!  I like how they say \"science\" in their slurs instead of \"God\" or \"JC.\" When Cartman calls himself in the past it is hilarious!  He finally gets to encounter his awful self but, of course, doesn't learn anything from it.\"Stanley's Cup\"--To get his bike out of impound, Stan coaches a peewee hockey team that includes a player dying of cancer.

Poles, Russians and Jews. From a small pre-war barracks for Polish soldiers, it follows the path to the mass slaughter house it became during WWII.

For those that survived death, the path 'home' wasn't as simple as one might think. Russian POW's were suspected of being 'spies' and relegated to the Gulags of Stalin's era.

{"reviewerID": "A1POFVVXUZR3IQ", "asin": "B000MMX5E4", "reviewerName": "Z Hayes", "helpful": [43, 44], "reviewText": "Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State makes for compelling viewing. It is divided into 6 chapters. The first chapter is titled \"Surprising Beginnings\" which basically introduces us to the origins of Auschwitz and how it was not initially designated as an extermination camp for Jews, but basically to house Polish political prisoners and later Russian POWs. In fact, the first gassing experiments in the camp were targeted at the Russian POWs.In the second chapter \"Orders and Initiatives\", we learn of the plans of Hitler, Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich to kill the Jews on a massive scale. Auschwitz is prepped for this purpose by the construction of gas chambers and the use of Zyklon B, a form of poisonous gas that was initially used to exterminate vermin and a disinfecting agent. We also learn about the Lodz Ghetto and its infamous Jewish leader, Rumkowski who seemed a controversial character in oppressing his own people, though not spared death himself, in the end. The crude initial gas chambers at Auschwitz are also shown, in reconstructions.In the third chapter \"Factories of Death\", the documentary explores how the systematic annihilation of the Jews was put into full operation, stretching all over Europe with Auschwitz being the center of extermination. The French authorities are also portrayed as being complicit in helping transport masses of Jews out of France to the \"east\". The other camps of death are also discussed such as Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor. It also mentions what happened to children of adult Jews who were sent off to work in the camps.The fourth chapter \"Corruption\" focusses on the blatant appropriation of murdered Jews and other peoples' belongings and valuables for the use of the Third Reich. Rudolf Hoess, the commandant of Auschwitz himself was removed from his position under charges of corruption [though he would return later to oversee mass killing on an astronomical scale]. This chapter also mentions Dr Josef Mengele, the infamous Nazi doctor of death, and also about the setting up of a brothel in the camp. Most importantly, this episode also deals with the resistance against the Nazi oppressors, most famously the uprising in Sobibor.The fifth chapter \"Murder and Intrigue\" deals with the playing out of international politics during the last nine months of 1944 and how nothing much was done by the Allies despite knowing by then that the jews and other innocents were being systematically and mechanically murdered by the Nazis. This was much to the detriment of the Hungarian Jews in particular, for they were deported to their deaths at a time where the gas chambers and crematoriums at Auschwitz in particular were operating at their optimum capacity. It also focusses on the Sonderkommando, the Jewish inmates who were forced to help process new arrivals designated for gassing, collecting their possessions, and disposing of their corpses.The final chapter \"Liberation and Revenge\" deals with how the Nazis tried to conceal their atrocities towards the end of the war. It also covers some of the trials of the Nazi war criminals after the war, the impact of liberation on the surviving camp inmates etc.Each chapter has at the end an interview between Linda Ellerbee with various personalities, mainly members of faculty of universities about the issues raised by each chapter.The series is not only well-put together with the extensive research compiled, but also the reenactments of historical events with actors and actresses [which I felt enhanced the series and not detract from it], the computer generated graphics of the camps as they were [they are mainly ruins now], and also most importantly, the testaments of the survivors in the present. It is a truly heartwrenching experience to see and hear these brave souls relive their horrific memories of such a bleak period in the history of mankind. A must-watch. I would also recommend \"Shoah\", a documentary that has more testimonies by survivors on the horrors they endured during World War Two.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A riveting series that explores Auschwitz and the Nazi implementation of the Final Solution", "unixReviewTime": 1326412800, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2012"},

The plot seemed to go in far too many different directions, far too many relationships unresolved and there were far too many questions that remained unanswered. I applaud the show for being ambitious and trying different things, but there were too few moments of Jack doing what he does best and too many moments where the show felt like a long and very boring civics lesson in terms of presidential power and the transfer of it.Also the problem that seems to be facing this show right now is that Jack has little to no emotional investment anymore in CTU or in his own life. His best friends are all dead (and he's had to kill one of them himself), and his lover is practically catatonic. All he really seems to have left is the job (and his daughter), but that just doesn't seem like enough.

Jack Bauer comes back from Chinese captivity a broken man. Then he is confronted with a series of terrorist attacks culminating in the explosion of an atomic bomb. The show also has turned somehow more gruesome since we early on see Jack bite the neck and kill one of his captors (Jack as vampire?)  and then eventually he will kill one of his friends and torture his brother. His father also turns out to be an enemy. And we get to know this pretty early on in the series. While the performance of Jack Bauer as burned-out is particularly well done at the same time it is distracting and the show suffers from his lack of motivation. There is also an unnecessary emphasis on a multitude of subplots which tend to cause more of a headache and do not contribute to the storyline. That said it is not bad, it is simply not as good as season 5.

This was why I was a bit surprised that season 6 had such a dip in quality.  (Spoilers)  Season 6 begins with a situation beyond the usual \"reality\" of 24, an america besieged with constant terrorist activity.  Bombings are frequent, and apparently common place.  This alone was a turn off, given the shows ability to feel real and unique.  I wasn't interested in an america under seige.  Add to that other unrealistic moments such as a nuclear bomb going off, and apparently no fallout or worry, as well as someone tortured with a drill returning to work, and you have a season that was particularly unrealistic.  Also, the characters, most of which were unlikeable, seeming to exist only for sake of moving a plot device along.  One moment the presidential aide is in favor of a harsher stance against terrosits, the next he's fighting against those who are.  Jack starts the season traumtized by a couple years in prision and tortured, but quickly is fine.  Oddly, though he spent really only one (1) day with CTU in the last three and a half years (after season 4, he only spent day 5, until day six with them), its shocking how well he know the technology and protocols of CTU.  They never change?  Even the twists were boring and unexciting, mainly as they come from a previous season.  Girl having an affair with a spy? seen it. Threat of nuclear bombs? seen it.  Heck, even the use of the good cop/bad cop president and vice president and invoking of the 25th amendment have been done.  (end spoilers).I guess the issue comes down to writing.  Its not that the actors did not work hard, they had little to work with.  The writing feels almost lazy this time around, as if trying to reycle old stories in a slightly different way.  Sadly, the twists weren't shocking, and usually not interesting.  The characters weren't as likeable, and the plot was a bit of a mess.

Some of them upon second viewing make you think \"Did I really think this show was good?\". But then again others make you realize that the shows you enjoyed from your youth were not just memories but were actually good shows. VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA is one of those series.As with the previous releases of the series, SEASON 4 VOLUME 1, holds up as well as the rest. The improvement of color over black and white is an obvious one when comparing to season one. But the characters have now had a chance to develop on screen and become familiar to us all. Too bad the series left the air not long after.The sixties gave us some of the greatest science fiction television ever seen. As early as THE TWILIGHT ZONE and moving forward to THE OUTER LIMITS we had anthologies that held our attention. And as for serialized tales, we had the original STAR TREK and more. No person helped this era out more so than Irwin Allen.Allen was the creator of some of the most remembered sci fi series from the time including THE TIME TUNNEL, LOST IN SPACE, LAND OF THE GIANTS and of course VOYAGE. Each of these series has had a release to DVD and have had the opportunity to give those of us children of the sixties the chance to relive those moments that held our attention each week, an hour at a time, as we watched incredible worlds unfold before our eyes.As for VOYAGE, the story mixed a combination of military and peacenik in one. It told the tales of the submarine Seaview, a high tech sub designed and operated by Admiral Nelson (Richard Basehart), a man who sees great things for the future and who uses his sub not as an offensive weapon but as a means to an end to help people around the globe.Along with Nelson are several main characters. The main one of these was Capt. Lee Crane (David Hedison), his second in command. While Nelson offered an elder statesman, Crane was the young eye candy to draw in girls, a man of action who took control when needed. Robert Dowdell as Lt. Comdr. Chip Morton, Del Monroe as Kowalski and Arch Whiting as Sparks helped round out the all male cast as they tackled world crises around the globe, saving the world over and over again.This particular season gave us a number of items to be concerned about opening with an episode that showed the Seaview tossed about was a volcano was about to blow cracking the world in two. Vincent Price paid a visit to the Seaview as a puppeteer who took control of various crewmen. A well loved plot device of the sixties, the ability of a bad guy to transform his appearance to do harm to whoever he chose was used. And time travel was brought into the picture again as well.VOYAGE played out like STAR TREK taken to inner space instead of outer and with an all male crew instead of one more integrated. But then TREK was in the future and VOYAGE in the present. Scenes of both ships being tossed about due to either underwater explosions or photon torpedoes gave us the cast tossing themselves about from side to side of the set. One could expect anyone from either cast feeling comfortable changing sets.For me it was glorious to watch as the flying sub once again lifted off out of the bottom of the Seaview and broke surface to fly across the sky. Like many I was lucky enough to have purchased the Aurora model kit and make my own flying sub to take a place of honor on the top of my desk. To find one today means a prolonged ebay search and paying an arm and a leg. Better it remains a fond memory.Not so this series. It no longer has to be a memory. Instead it is something that can be enjoyed again and again. And it can be shared with my son and later perhaps my grandchildren.One of the best things that we can take with us, those of us who watched these shows when they were fresh and new, is the sense of hope that they offered. Rather than a post apocalyptic world of bombed out buildings and survivors clad in furs and remnants of clothing, we were shown a world where we could use science to help build a better world. We were offered a world where not just races and genders got along but aliens as well. Wouldn't it be great if the world had that same sense of hope once more? Perhaps sharing these old television shows might just be the first step in that direction.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "THE SEAVIEW STILL SAVES THE DAY", "unixReviewTime": 1244332800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2009"},

But the scary ramps up too. Everything escalates. The plot of Season One is extended greatly as Sam tries to track down others 'like him'. We get great guest stars (Katharine Isabelle from the Ginger Snaps films; Linda Blair.... LINDA BLAIR! from the Exorcist)and we witness the come back of one who becomes a fan favourite: Jim Beaver's Bobby Singer.

Hindu and Muslin faith enters center stage, and they do it well, given as much or more reverence than the Catholic and Christian dogma. Perhaps the greatest achievement of  this season is that the writers merge the 'monster of the week' theme by making those monster hunts have some allusion to the metaplot or even fuel the the on-going episodes. So just a head's up: the show is quickly veering into theological discovery. But - they are smart enough not to shove it down anyone's throat.Now, for the fun stuff: the CGI is outright brilliant this season, and it only gets better as the season go on.

At the same time Dean is dying and his father exchanges his own life for Dean's but yet gives Dean the mission to look after Sam and save him, or kill him if he can't protect and save him. It ends with Dean doing the same bargaining as his father for the life of Sam who was killed in the dead western city of Cold Oak. Dean manages to get one year of living before he is reclaimed.This second season tells us too a little more about the demons. Apart from the everyday black-eyed demons who are tortured souls that stopped being human and became demons, there is a particular and more powerful one, the yellow-eyed demon, and though we are not told what or who he really is, he is what we can call a higher class demon. He is the one who accepted to take John's life in the place of Dean's. He is the one who has chosen Sam for a special mission that will be uncovered during this second season. What is that mission?Strangely enough all the hunting is for that yellow-eyed demon nothing but training for Sam and the training is not only directed at Sam. This second season is focusing on the hunting by the two brothers of the yellow-eyed demon. But, this seems to be part of a plan elaborated by him to train Sam and make him understand his importance and his uniqueness. With others like him, that are called \"psychic\" in the series, they have been selected by this special demon to accomplish a task, that is to say lead the demonic army that is to break loose from Hell. Of these \"psychic\", Sam will meet four of them, but there are more, all born on the same year 1983, and whose mothers all died in a nursery fire. We come across them now and then but they do not seem to be very resilient. In a final attempt at selecting the right \"general\" to bring in the armies of Hell out of the deep,he brings together four psychic and a black veteran from Afghanistan (who also has special abilities in a dead western city, Cold Oak in South Dakota, for the sole survivor to accomplish the mission.The Black chap, Jake, will manage, under blackmail from the yellow-eyed monster and menaces against his mother and sister, to kill Sam by cutting his spine through. He is an obviously well trained GI. But Dean will manage to revive Sam by a trip to Crossroads Inn, Mississippi to meet with a crossroad demon, that grants wishes that was tracked down in a previous episode, and to bargain his life against Sam's. He will get a one year survival time for himself. But that enables the two brothers to go to Bobby who had noticed that evil and demonic elements were concentrating around a special zone in Wyoming.Sam will actually find out that in this sector there is a cemetery and a crypt in the center, built by Samuel Colt surrounded by churches connected by railroads building up a pentacle or pentagram, which is called in the series a \"devil's trap\", that can imprison demons if they enter it. The crypt in the cemetery is supposed to be the gate to hell, the gateway through which the armies of Hell will invade the earth. This is an important specification in the series. Several episodes are openly dedicated to Catholic beliefs: angels for one, but also a Catholic priest in a Catholic church who is shot dead on the steps to his church and cannot receive the last rites. He becomes a haunting ghost and is redeemed by the priest of the church.This leads to a discussion that emerges several times on the existence of angels. Dean does not believe. Sam does believe. This definitely gives the series a Christian if not Catholic ring, especially with the number of times the Catholic exorcizing rite or ritual chant is used, though it is never uttered by a priest in the series, which makes it surprisingly iconoclastic. Never people believing in exorcism would consider a lay man could perform the rite. It is the same thing with the use of holy water. For example when Ellen, the inn-keeping lady of the roadside diner that is a meeting place for spirit hunters, comes at the end of the season for help after her diner and everyone in it were burnt to ashes, she is asked to drink a glass of holy water to make sure she is not possessed. This is definitely Catholic, but at the same time always performed by non-believers or even atheists. This is a reference to a religion from the point of view of people who are totally unconcerned by it as if you may not believe in God but God believes in you. Does he?The special gun John Winchester had saved and kept for its final task and that he had traded with the yellow-eyed demon for Dean's life and that still had one special bullet, was in fact the key to the door of the crypt that enables the armies of hell to come into this world. But the weapon only and not the bullet. The gun was recuperated, too late, by the Winchesters and the bullet killed the yellow-eyed demon, or can we be sure it did?That's when the tale turned ironical and sour. The poor Jake who had accepted, willy nilly and more nilly than willy, to be the servant of the demon did manage to open the gate and thus to enable the yellow-eyed demon to enter the final pentacle, but he was shot on the spot by the Winchesters. He probably died smiling since he thus saved his mother and his sister. But he got nothing out of the deal at all. That's the irony of those devilish missions: the possessed do what they are supposed to do, and at times it takes a lot of energy from the demon to convince them. Like in this special case, where Jack has a mission that a demon or a possessed human could not accomplish since they could not enter the pentacle, but otherwise demons only take possession of human bodies and use them as \"meat suits\"But this second season has a touch of itself first of all in the constant debate about the worthiness of the fight, the worthiness of one brother being ready to die for the other and vice versa (if it were true they might even die together one on top of the one on top of himself.) This debate is constant, deep in many ways and perfectly well acted for us to believe that what is mostly a verbal claim no one ever makes true is probably true for these two brothers. That the father accepts to die in the place of his sons is normal since his sons are his heirs, his continuation into eternal human life. But for two brothers it is surprising especially since in our common vision of two brothers, even twins, and these are no twins, there is always some amount of hostility when it is not hatred and jealousy, which is indeed present in these two brothers. That can be explained by the fact they grew up apart from the world, taking care of each other while their father was hunting this yellow-eyed demon that killed his wife/their mother. Also, the animosity would rather be localized between Sam and John, Dean being the lever, the path between these two characters that have antagonistic trajectories.Those two brothers are so much in love with one another that they are ready to sacrifice their whole life for an adventure together. This is not inhuman. This is superhuman. This is an idealistic vision and the actors make us believe it is true, possible. That level of intimacy between two brothers is admirable and beautiful, even if, deep behind my mind's eye I kind of doubt it a little bit.There is a last remark I want to make on this season. The South was finally represented this year with Mississippi, but in a rather unfavorable light as a place of demons, curses and other devilish traffics. Yet Mississippi is the place where the resurrection of Sam is purchased. We are no longer dealing with anything Christian here but with something like voodoo, the originally African religion of the Blacks in the South that has survived in spite of all the Christianizing performed by the whites over the centuries.But this leads to the plain fact that all black characters are evil in a way or another, either because they are easily manipulated by some demon or evil mind, or because they are sort of genetically evil, even Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is shown as unable to see beyond his book of rules, and who is turned upside down and made a fool of by the two Winchester brothers and their female and not so much experienced lawyer. And fooled is a euphemism: he turns out to be a plain dummie. But the FBI agent will remain on the tracks of course because he is a Fox Beyond and you may choose, Insanity, Intelligence, Intuition or Impotence.We could say that they are doing wrong while hoping to do good : nave would be a better word to describe them. Jack is hoping to save the ones he loves, but doesn't understand that the whole planet will die, while the Winchesters brothers are willing to die for the sake of humanity. The FBI agent is not trying to understand what is going on but wants to catch two fugitives that are threats to his un-supernatural world, where a ghost belongs in a book. He is too rational to understand, maybe to good at what he does to think outside his pragmatic, Cartesian referential mind. And he lacks the creativity or the beliefs that what is really and what he sees are two different things.The season ends well since it has finally redeemed the father and created a tremendous suspense as for the future since in twelve months Dean will die.

Take a look at \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" a show which, by the way, has a heavy influence on this wonderful series.  BtVS, like \"Supernatural,\" had humble beginnings, but blew the audience and critics away with a stellar second season.  \"Supernatural\" does the very same.Everything that was good about the show in the first season was strengthened here.  Dean and Sam's relationship has become layered and, as it is really a story about the bond of the two brothers, becomes the dramatic center of the show.  Replacing the \"monster of the week\" format of season one is an over-arching story that develops throughout the season.  Even standalone episodes contribute to the main story of the season.  If the high level of continuity maintained in this series is enough to get the horror/fantasy fan in you to get all sweaty, get this.  The mythology is expanded and strengthened.  The black and white, good and evil of demons/humans gets thrown into that grey area we're all so interested in.  The comedy--again, very Buffy-esque--is amped up, including many laugh-out-loud moments.  The battle between the two brothers and the forces of evil becomes way more epic and also more tragic.All of this comes to a head in the two-part season finale, which is--as I mentioned above--a moment of television perfection.

But there is no question that that show made some major strides forward in its sophomore and junior years, deepening the storylines and finding new and innovative ways to structure episodes.  Because one of the biggest problems with the show in Season One was its episodic \"demon of the week\" narrative structure, the show grew far more interesting and engaging.In these two seasons SUPERNATURAL also became a far more playful show, willing to engage in self-parody and capable of poking fun at itself.  In a way, this mimics the way that one of the shows that has most influenced the series, THE X-FILES, grew.  That show for the first couple of episodes was almost unceasingly serious.  It was a great show despite this, but it really took off once -- especially with several extraordinary scripts by Darin Morgan -- when it began mixing in comic episodes.  Season Two of THE X-FILES saw a mildly comic (though mainly jut flat out weird) scripted by Morgan, late in Season Two about circus freaks entitled \"Humbug.\"  But the first out and out laugh fest was another Morgan script, \"War of the Coprophages,\" in which Mulder and a scientist named Bambi do battle against cockroaches.  (Darin Morgan only wrote a half dozen scripts for THE X-FILES, but four of those would be among the ten best X-FILES episodes ever, one of them the Emmy Award winning episode \"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose,\" which is one of the finest TV episodes of all time, garnering an Emmy not just for Morgan but for guest actor Peter Boyle.)  Certainly THE X-FILES seemed to be an even greater influence on SUPERNATURAL in these two seasons than in Season One.  One Season Two episode, in which Sam and Dean give offer Bobby differing accounts of events calls to mind THE X-FILES episode \"Bad Blood,\" in which Mulder and Scully give contradictory reports of events surrounding vampires in Texas (along with a sheriff played by Luke Wilson -- both episodes were among the dozens of TV episodes or movies loosely based over the years on the great Kurosawa film RASHOMON, which details four incompatible accounts of events in the woods in medieval Japan).  I don't know how much of this can be credited to Ben Edlund (creator of THE TICK in all his forms, as well as a writer on FIREFLY and ANGEL) joining the writing staff.  But in every way the writing in these two seasons showed a sharp increase in sophistication and flexibility.  The scripts in Season One were stiff, uninteresting, and frequently just flat out boring.  That was rarely the case as the show progressed.  No doubt part of the improvement stemmed from the producers gaining new concessions from the CW, which surely allowed them to stray away from the standalone, episodic format that so thoroughly hampered the show in Season One.I frankly found just about every episode in Season One of the show to be completely forgettable.  But several episodes in Seasons Two and Three stand out.  For instance, one particularly good episode in Season Two does some great twists on the genie legends, with the help of an excellent guest performance by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's Tricia Helfer.  That episode is emblematic of the new maturity of the show.  I can honestly say that I was not surprised (nor scared) by a single thing that happened in Season One.  It was almost intentionally predictable.  But in Helfer's episode there were some truly interesting twists and surprises.  In just about every way, the show got better in these two seasons.I'm still not what one might term a major fan of the show.  Even after three seasons it is a fairly conservative show.  It certainly has done little to redefine the horror genre and it has not expanded the scope of horror or fantasy in the way that either THE X-FILES or BUFFY did.  Still, there is a great deal to say for a show that is excellent even if it is not innovative.  And I admire any series that gets better as it goes along.  I received the first three seasons of the series as a gift, but I frankly did not think I was going to continue with the show after finishing the three sets.  But now I both plan to buy Season Four come this September and DVR the show upon its return this fall (it will be going against a very similar show with what is surely a pretty substantial audience overlap, FRINGE -- why do networks do this? -- the only then that FOX assures in doing this is that both shows will get lower ratings than they might otherwise -- still, FRINGE is a show I really love, so I'll keep up with SUPERNATURAL via DVR).

So, I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3. There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who aren't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV, not a single one, that my wife and I don't flock to week to week, other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception. As the 3rd season played out, we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season, all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger. A serial rapist. A murder on campus. All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then, when the show started back up, all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes. The following episodes were, for lack of better words, UNEVENTFUL. All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending. What did they do? What happened? Did the writers lose interest? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes? This is what I think. Personally, I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them. So, they in turn, gave up on the CW.All speculation aside, VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season. The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact, but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it's 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts. The ratings that they're suffering aren't because of quality of show, but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies... like the big boys do... cause we're watching... and unfortunately, we're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "WHAT HAPPENED?????", "unixReviewTime": 1188172800, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2007"},

By this time, several interesting characters were gone- Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter)and Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin)most important among them. Another problem with the third season is that there were too many threads left hanging and unexplained subplots, perhaps to have been picked up in the 4th season, which never materialized.

All your worldly possessions. Where are you from? Brigadoon?\"Nope, Neptune in Cali isn't exactly as  magical as Brigadoon. Neptune, like most places, hides its share of festering secrets and nefarious intents, which keeps busy the hardworking Mars Investigations agency, staffed by Keith Mars and his ever resourceful 19-year-old daughter Veronica. So for this 3rd and final season, we again say hello - and bid farewell - to these folks up in Neptune. With high school flush in her rearview mirror, part-time shamus, now full-time college student Veronica Mars turns her sardonic attention to life at Hearst College. But some things simply don't change for our feisty heroine. She still helps out her dad in the gumshoe department and still suffers an exhausting relationship with her emotionally fractured bad boy of a boyfriend, Logan Echolls. And she still touts a rep for ferreting out, and digging in, and nosing about. And, since she does get results, she's soon up to her neck putting out fires and solving campus dilemmas.Some plot SPOILERS follow.VERONICA MARS - THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is still very good, but it's the weakest of the three seasons. This time the main ongoing story arcs revolve around Veronica hunting down a campus serial rapist and sleuthing another baffling murder. On a smaller scale, her mystery plate is heaped with servings the likes of a stolen team playbook, some missing tapes, an accusation of plagiarism, a vanished heiress, a secret society, a holdup at a costume casino party, etc. So add that to her freshman woes. And, being Veronica Mars, she also doesn't take long to alienate an activist sorority and a raunchy fraternity, as well as the weasely assistant of her criminology professor. But at least her crime solving is made easier by her gigs as Library Helpdesk girl and as the photographer of the college paper. And she's always got her buds to lean on, Wallace, Mac, and Logan, even if their onscreen appearances are sporadic (just one reason this season isn't as good).But the show's not all about Veronica (it's just mostly about Veronica). My second favorite character in the show is Keith Mars, and he has his own messes to muddle thru. Logan continues to have his own issues and comes close to overdoing the tortured soul thing; Wallace juggles basketball with his mechanical engineering aspirations; Weevil is now out on parole (from his misdeeds in Season 2) but must maintain a job; and Mac, well, she's still shy. Meanwhile, Veronica's clique widens in the forms of the happy-go-lucky, kinda dull Piz (Wallace's roomie) and party girl, kinda dull Parker (Mac's roomie). So, hello, new loves and old loves, and there's even a hasty wedding. As usual, it's a blending of heartbreak and mystery and life lessons and surprises. Just life in Neptune.SPOILERS end.So I managed to blast thru all 20 episodes (plus extras) in one sleep-deprived - but worth it - marathon viewing session. Something to be said for watching your favorite shows on dvd instead of television, the dvds lending an instant gratification and an immediacy which suck in the viewer even more. Having said that, not only am I bummed out about the series's abrupt demise but pretty upset that there wasn't even a proper ending to the series. Again, only 20 episodes here, with the last one leaving its audience hanging off a cliff. Not cool, CW.Two paragraphs now about the plentiful bonus stuff, which can be found on the 6th disc (there are 6 discs in all in this set). Most interesting and quite bittersweet are the two segments devoted to what would have been Season 4: one's a 12 minute clip giving us a feel for what the next season would've been like (Veronica in the FBI), the other has the series creators talking about their pitch presentation for season 4 and their planned new direction for the show. Both segments, to me, feel decidedly unsettling because most of the familiar stuff (ie: the town of Neptune, the school backdrop, Veronica's father and circle of friends) had been taken away. A whole new mess of characters are introduced, all of whom I felt a bit hostile to.Under the banner \"Going Undercover with Rob Thomas\" (and with his sycophantic right hand man Dan Etheridge) we get 9 ho-hum featurettes: \"Main Titles: Why the Change?\"; \"Rob's Directing Experience\"; \"Favorite Guest Star Moments\"; \"Veronica Mars: Mean Girl\" - in which series creator Rob Thomas addresses the public outcry that Veronica was too mean in season 3; \"The Politics of Veronica Mars\" - concerning the negative reactions to the show; Thomas goes over his \"Favorite Veronica and Logan Moments\" and his \"Favorite Veronica and Keith Moments\"; \"Do-Overs?\" - scenes of which Thomas wasn't too fond; and \"Highlights\" - more of Thomas's fave moments. Then 24 minutes worth of 16 unaired scenes with Thomas's intros; a 7 minute gag reel (best was Enrico Colantoni's many takes of \"I finally got the police report on the ****'s suicide\"). The Webisode gallery offers 5 clips, the most fun of which is Kristen Bell and Chris Lowell Q & A-ing each other. There's also a guidebook which breaks down the episodes. A ton of extras here, so I shouldn't gripe; yet I wish Kristen Bell and cast had done an interview or even an episode commentary.For three years VERONICA MARS has delivered the goods, consistently bringing it with the clever and the funny, with the heartwrenching angst and the occasional melodramatic twist. Once in a while, my thoughts were even provoked. Along with the crisp plotting and snappy banter, the show presented relationships that were complicated and fluid and real and multi-faceted mysteries which perplexed. But by this season's end the show had kind of broken away from its normal pattern, that of each episode being pivotal and acting as chapters to one cohesive storyline. The last five episodes instead tended to be self-contained ones, and that's when the show really began to feel fractured. There are less gems here than in the first 2 seasons, although most of the episodes are still darn watchable. If I had to pick favorites, three episodes instantly spring to mind: \"Debasement Tapes,\" in which Paul Rudd guest stars as a rumpled, near alcoholic rock star living off his old glory; \"Postgame Mortem,\" in which a moping Logan ends up babysitting a cheerful 11-year-old girl; and episode 20, which ends the series just as things begin to get darn good.In the acting department, Jason Dohring (the ever moody Logan) again stands out. Enrico Colantoni continues to make a case for his character Keith Mars as being the best dad in the universe. My most cherished moments in the series have to do with Veronica and Keith doing their daughter-dad thing. There's just this amazing level of understanding, caring, and humor between them, and conveyed wonderfully by Bell and Colantoni. Whenever they're in a scene together, the world is good. And, as always, Kristen Bell, playing that spunky, tenacious girl detective, effortlessly carries the show.But, well, the show's done now, and the superb cast scattered, with Bell having moved on to HEROES and Jason Dohring, to MOONLIGHT. But it's still gonna take a while before the bittersweet lyrics to the theme song stop sticking in my brain: \"A long time ago, we used to be friends.\" VERONICA MARS, you see, it was a very good show.

Who is behind the \"Welcome Wagon\" and steals new student's stuff?  Who would kidnap a monkey?  And where is the missing member of the board of trustees?Unlike previous seasons, there are two bigger mysteries.  The first involves the serial rapist on the Hearst campus.

The mysteries were sharp, requiring concentration to follow every week.  Yet the clues were there.  Veronica has a sharp sense of humor that is wonderful for lightening the mood of the usually dark show.  The relationship soap opera, while at times annoying, never got too bad.  And all the acting was top notch.Having praised it, this is my least favorite season of the show.  And it's not because there were two shorter mysteries and a couple stand alone episodes.  It was because the adult tone, definitely always present, became even more pronounced.  Of course, that's what you'd expect with rape being a subject for half the season.

I start my review on that note not because I plan to dispel claims of a decrease in quality (creator Rob Thomas addresses these issues on the special features without dismissing them) but to let the fans of \"Veronica Mars\" know that they have absolutely nothing to worry about.  This is classic V. Mars.Veronica Mars, a show very centered on the high school setting, easily survives something that has killed countless shows:  The shift to college.  Hearst College is a great new location for the majority of the action of the series, giving us many new and interesting sets and a variety of new characters.  Though the show may suffer from too much focus on said new characters (namely Piz, a true tool) instead of established favorites (Wallace catches it the worst here), the lost points are gained back by the strength of the series.  Kristen Bell consistently giving a stellar performance as the titular Veronica.  Usually--I know this is true for a lot of people--the most captivating characters are the supporting ones.  However, Veronica is simply the best character the series has to offer and that's saying a lot, as the characterization in this series is almost always flawless.  With characters like Logan, Keith Mars, Dick Casablancas, Wallace, and Weevil, one can't go wrong.Changes were made (due to pressure from the Network), most notably the shift of the usual format of a season-long arc carried out through mostly standalone episodes to a very different kind of set up.  The season is instead divided into three different mystery arcs.  The first few episodes focus on a rapist on the Hearst campus, the next revolving around a classic whodunnit murder mystery, and the final five episodes (the weakest of the series) are essentially standalones.  They function well enough as standalones, but the strength of the series has always been in it's story arcs.Another plus about this season is the fact that Disc Six is packed with previews.  We get the never-before-seen pitch for what Season Four of Veronica Mars would have been (which never came to fruition, thanks to the idiocy of television executive Les Moonves) and more extras than you will know what to do with.

{"reviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "asin": "B000MVN8GK", "reviewerName": "Robert Moore", "helpful": [94, 135], "reviewText": "Warning!  Spoilers littered throughout this review!Note:  I'll rewrite the following paragraph soon (pressing matters keeps me from doing more right now) but we now know from reliable sources that Veronica is not going to be back in any way.  She will not be back as a college student and she will not be back as an FBI agent in a reworked format.  The only reason the CW hasn't already made the announcement, according to Kristin of Eonline.com, is that they are afraid of the anger fans will heap on them.  They will deserve that anger!  For me the CW will always be the network that made room for a mother-daughter beauty pageant, a second season of the Pussycat Doll show, and THE FARMER TAKES A WIFE.  It had room for absolutely miserable excuses for shows like these, but couldn't find room on its schedule for VERONICA MARS.  That pretty much tells you all you need to know about the CW.I will revise this first paragraph as soon as we know for certain, but it is not true, as has been almost universally reported, that VERONICA MARS has been cancelled.  As of today this is what we know for certain:  it has not yet been placed on the fall schedule.  The head of the CW, Dawn Ostroff, says that while the VERONICA MARS of the past three seasons is gone, she is working with Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell on a possible future project, which most believe means the widely reported successor series to VERONICA MARS, in which the plot would shoot to the future, to deal with Veronica Mars as a FBI agent.  This would be accompanied with a completely new supporting cast and perhaps even a title change in the show.  Numerous sources have reported and Dawn Ostroff herself has stated that she has until June 15, 2007 to make a decision on whether to pick this new series up.  To be honest, not many insiders are offering fans much hope that this series will be picked up.  But as the old expression goes, \"The opera ain't over until the fat lady sings.\"  Well, she isn't singing yet, but she might be warming up.  We'll have to keep our fingers crossed that the next three weeks will bring some good news.Certainly we need not fear for the long term future of Kristen Bell.  One of the most talented actresses on TV, she is not only lovely but a gifted actress, singer, and dancer all in one diminutive package.  The question is not whether she will be involved in some project in the future, but which one.  Most immediately it appears that she will be the narrator for GOSSIP GIRL (this might not happen if she plays VERONICA MARS in some way, but even if she does, it might be possible for her to serve as narrator--she did do the narration for the pilot that critics saw at the Upfront in New York).If VERONICA MARS is cancelled and we see no more of our pint-sized but large-spirited teen detective, we can, in a way, be grateful that we got three full seasons.  I fell in love with this show immediately and watched it religiously through its entire run.  When UPN inexplicably scheduled it opposite one of my other favorite shows, LOST, I recorded LOST and watched VERONICA MARS live.  Veronica was when she debuted the latest in a string of strong female characters to have arisen in the wake of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER making TV safe for such creatures.  She was, in fact, the heroine who most resembled Buffy.  The first two seasons were simply glorious, two utterly perfect seasons that topped almost everything else on television.  Season Three, unfortunately, represented something of a slip for the show.  (I refuse it give it less than five stars, however, simply because it was still better than most else on television.)  Many people have felt this and have speculated on why.  My own belief is that VERONICA MARS suffered from network interference.  Both Season One and Season Two were driven by deep emotional needs in Veronica to solve major mysteries.  Season Three had no such deep mystery (though there were two lesser ones) and as a result lacked the emotional intensity of the previous seasons.  No doubt a lot of this was the result of the network putting pressure on the show to make it accessible to new viewers.  We've seen this take place again and again over the years with various shows and the brute fact is:  it doesn't work.  Mainly such an approach wins no new viewers and alienates many of the viewers the show already has.  I spent all of Season Three with a mild feeling of disappointment, yearning for the intensity to return.  Yet, sometimes it did.  \"Spit and Eggs,\" which resolved the campus rape mystery, was as stressful and as wonderful as the best Season One and Two episodes, but it turned out to be the exception and the rules.My own thinking on the \"how to win new fans\" issue with series is that watering down the show never works.  Instead, I think the way to go is to rely on online streaming and DVD to get potential fans caught up.  I didn't, for instance, start watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS last fall when it debuted.  But I was able to catch up by watching it on NBC.com.  The CW put up a few episodes for streaming, but only a few.  What they needed to do was place the entire season online for its shows, much like NBC does.  Serial dramas like VERONICA MARS can attract and build up a fanatically devoted fanbase, but you keep that fanbase by continuing to produce a high quality serial drama, not by forcing it to become more and more episodic.  The truth is that networks almost always complicate rather than improve a series through their meddling.Another perplexing problem with Season Three was the near disappearance of several supporting characters.  At times I wondered if Wallace was still part of the show.  And Weevil played less and less of a role as the season went along.  My understanding is that Francis Capra, who plays Weevil, had some health problems during the season (and that medication he was taking led to a rather startling weight gain early in the year with accompanying skin problems--these seem to be on the way to clearing up by season end).  Mac became an opening credits character, but she didn't seem to play any more important role than she had in the past.Still, some things remained really great about the show.  Veronica and her father continued to have one of the most satisfying, if not the most satisfying, father-daughter relationship on TV.  Veronica continued to impress and overwhelm all those disposed to doubt her.  And as a huge BATTLESTAR GALACTICA fan she made the best frakkin' BSG references on all TV (though Dwight Schruette of THE OFFICE and Seth Cohen of THE O.C. gave her a run for her money), even helping one client find a woman she met at the BSG session at Comicon.  But a lot of the passion of the previous years was gone.  TV critics noticed.  For its first two seasons, VERONICA MARS was probably one of the five most critically praised shows on TV.  In Season Three it probably dropped out of the top ten to somewhere in the 10-15 spot.  I blame this entirely on network interference.The most heartbreaking part of the season came with the finale, which left several plot lines unresolved.  This was not entirely the network's fault.  Rob Thomas obstinately refused to do a \"just in case\" ending for the season.  He apparently wanted to increase the pressure on the network to renew the show.  That is one philosophy, but I prefer Joss Whedon's when he was on BUFFY.  His idea was that you never knew whether you would get cancelled (fortunately BUFFY never did, though both ANGEL and FIREFLY would be), so you leave the end of each season in a place where it could both lead into something if you get renewed, but it would be satisfying to the fans if you don't.  EVERWOOD filmed two versions of its Season Three finale in case it didn't get renewed.  It didn't, but thankfully a finale existed that wrapped up the show  Now, unless the FBI Agent Veronica Mars series materializes, we are left with a dangling show.  Moreover, it will dangle most likely regardless, since a time shift to several years in the future will take the show well past the subsequent events on the show.  Networks should do a better job of ending serial drams with dedicated fanbases, but the executive producers need to take some responsibility as well.  I can understand Rob Thomas's reluctance to not go gentle into that good night, but I wish he had filmed an episode that did a better job of wrapping up the series.  As it is, we are left wondering whether the homicidal nutjob Logan beat up got his revenge, whether Jake Kane was once again a part of the show's story, and whether Vinnie Van Low was the new sheriff of Neptune.Television is going to miss this show.  Although NBC debuts THE BIONIC WOMAN in the fall of 2007 (with a crackerjack production staff, a strong cast, and some very good writers, making this look like a more like one of the more promising series of 2007-2008), television is lacking somewhat right now in strong female characters.  In fact, only BATTLESTAR GALACTICA with characters like Laura Roslin, Sharon Agathon, and Starbuck has much in the way of strong women.  I'm delighted that we got to see Kristen Bell portray Veronica for three wonderful years, but I'm still going to miss her mightily.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The final casebook of detective Veronica Mars", "unixReviewTime": 1179792000, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2007"},

Well, call me Mr. Staypuff because I'm a genuine \"marshmallow\" fan of this show.  Growing up I was a big reader and quickly ran through all the Tom Swift and Hardy Boys books published.  My next door neighbors were three sisters who had the entire Nancy Drew library which I also read and enjoyed.  Maybe this is why I love this series-  and now this movie.  The characters reunited in another mystery was a lot of fun.  I think the success of the Kickstarter campaign to fund this film starts with Kristin Bell, she totally sells this character and owns it.  Pretty, smart, and sassy she's very entertaining and compelling to watch. A contemporary, darker Nancy Drew strikes just the right note and is credible.  The support cast of largely unknown actors work well together and the sprinkling of known actor guest stars are blended well into the stories.  Of special mention is Enrico Colantoni as Veronica's dad, P.I. and former sherriff Keith Mars.  I only know him from his work on \"Just Shoot Me\" which was a comedic role but he's perfect as Veronica's father.  My only frustration with the series was the seemingly endless poor relationship choices Veronica makes for such an intelligent young woman. That said I was never a team Piz fan and guess her serial boyfriend Logan works the best.  I think this movie gives fans some closure since at the conclusion of season 3 Rob Thomas and company did not know if they'd been renewed or not.

Freakin' yay for the Kickstarter campaign and its 91,585 backers and the shattered records, including that it met its $2 million goal in the first day of the campaign and went on to triple the thing at $5.7 million. The behind-the-scenes story is so feel good. Veronica Mars, the movie, is essentially a love letter from the cast & crew to the fans.A long time ago, we used to be friendsBut I haven't thought of you lately at all...It's been roughly ten years since we last saw Veronica, back when she was a teenaged private eye poking her nose in everyone's biz in Neptune, Cali. The movie's opening sequence fills us in on what she's been up to. Veronica is interviewing for a place in a prestigious New York law firm that especializes in dumping frivolous cases before they get to court. (So much for what would've been the 4th Season premise of her landing in the FBI.) Veronica confides that she got out of Neptune when she was 19, got herself a B.A. in psychology at Stanford, was near the top of her class in Columbia law. Interview over, Veronica hopes for the best.She claims that her amateur sleuthing days are in the rear view and her nosy disposition tamped down. And when her bad boy ex Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is implicated in murder and he calls her, pleading for her help, she assures her current beau that she's only going to provide Logan with lawyery advise. So it's back home for Veronica, a reunion with her ex with the baggage and a dive back into a posh but then scuzzy space redolent of leftover angst and reputations ruined and inner demons outed but never exorcised. That unknown murderer lurking in the midst - because it can't possibly be Logan, right? - almost seems a footnote. Just another day in Neptune.The best bits about the television show get reincarnated. It's still ultimately about the underdog, the perceived loser, putting one over the bullies. Very much intact is that marvelous father-daughter synergy between Kristen Bell and the fantastic Enrico Colantoni. Veronica and Logan's relationship is still... complicated. Veronica still cracks wise. She's still incredibly dogged. There's huge gratification in catching up with a host of familiar faces. Everyone came back! Plus, there's a surprise cameo or three. Okay, if you don't know Veronica Mars from Bruno Mars, you won't get it. But this isn't about luring in the uninitiated. See, you've caught me in mid-celebration. I'm still gobsmacked that there's a Veronica Mars movie, and I think we marshmallows suspected it wasn't gonna make tons of money, but so what? Maybe tomorrow I'll watch this again and then I'll notice flaws. But that's tomorrow. This movie is a collaborative labor of love among the filmmakers, the cast, and the ardent, mobilized fans. For now, I'm keeping it on the pedestal.The DVD's bonus stuff:- \"By the Fans: The Making of the Veronica Mars Movie\" - a very cool documentary in which Rob thomas, Kristen Bell and the entire Veronica Mars cast take you from its record-breaking Kickstarter launch to pre-production to the first day on set and beyond! Includes a segment from the backers' perspectives as they show up as extras on the set (00:55:36 minutes long)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Veronica Mars pokes her nose  in the box office", "unixReviewTime": 1404691200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2014"},

Many of the recurring characters from the television show have small appearances, but the focus of the movie rests squarely on Veronica and Logan. Like many of the episodes, the &#34;mystery&#34; is revealed in the closing moments in fairly quick order. The mystery, while important, is not the point of the story, the characters are. The mystery is simply the delivery vehicle.The pacing of the movie feels somewhat rushed, but that may simply be due to the number of acknowledgements of the original series that it tries to fit into a mere 100 minutes of movie time. These little glimpses of what has become of Veronica's past life are not entirely necessary. They are there for the fans. But since this was a fan-funded project, it's entirely understandable.One need not have any clue about Veronica Mars before seeing this film. It is capable of standing on its own. However, for those watching the film without first having watched the series, it may come across as a bit shallow as there simply isn't enough time to get invested into what happens with each character, leaving the mystery the sole reason for watching the film.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A fun reunion with old friends.", "unixReviewTime": 1402358400, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2014"},

Admittedly I was glad to get back together with the old crowd and I remembered most of the characters.Veronica (Kristen Bell), now involved with good-guy Piz (Chris Lowell) has recently graduated from law school and is on the verge of accepting a job with a prestigious NYC law firm.  But she's drawn back to richy-bitchy Neptune, CA when one-time bad-boy paramour Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is arrested for murdering his pop singer girlfriend.  Oh, and it's her 10th year high school reunion.  Against her better judgment, Veronica can't turn Logan down, presumably to help screen defense attorneys.  But it goes further as she digs deeper and deeper into the crime.Thanks to some fine dialog written by Rob Thomas (also directed) and Diane Ruggiero, Veronica is as snappy as ever when it comes to retorts and one-liners.  Logan, outside the murder charge, has redeemed himself and is now a Navy Lieutenant.  His best friend Dick (Ryan Hansen) is still a goofball and a key to solving the murder.

Her main problem is the fact that he cheated when he explained that his heroine was alive, but there was also the fact that he was second guessing his audience. Instead of writing something that he could be proud of, he wrote something that he thought that the audience wanted. In many ways, the decline in quality of Veronica Mars reflected this issue. In the third season of Veronica Mars, Rob Thomas veered away from the season long arc and the feminist context and chose instead to focus on shorter story arcs and one-off episodes that didn't tie into the arcs. Instead of making the show easy for potential new fans, Thomas disappointed the existing fans.There was also the issue of the heroine graduating from high school. The teenage detective angle worked better when the setting was high school and there was a great metaphor about tying in hard boiled mysteries with high school where no one really is what they appear to be. Buffy recovered from the same setback, but just barely.This movie tries to go in the opposite direction of the third season by making a movie that is solely for the fans but retains that same desperate &#34;LOVE ME&#34; vibe that wrecked the last season. A little fan service is nice. It's cool to see Mac and Wallace again. Veronica working to solve the case and manipulating the police force to do it is fine. It's even nice to see Veronica and Logan fall into their old patterns.Ken Marino has established himself in comedic roles in shows like Party Down and Children's Hospital so why not bring back Vinnie Van Lowe.Yet, a little goes a long way and too much just becomes aggravating. Do we really need to get Piz again? Especially when he is still the nice guy that Veronica basically ignores. Does Madison have to be a one-dimensional villain ten years later? Weevil shows up to AGAIN end up on the wrong side of the law. Krysten Ritter appears and then reminds everyone who she was in season 2. The only strange moment of restraint in the movie was not bringing back Adam Scott as the teacher who had sex with a student even though the movie revolves around Carrie Bishop who accused him of rape in the Mars vs. Mars episode from season 1. When the ten year reunion has a tribute to the dead classmates, you almost expect it to take over the movie since there were a lot of dead high school students on the show.With all the fan service, the director and writer forget to tell a compelling story. It's a two hour episode with references that require the Veronica Mars wiki to fully get. Unfortunately, as you are referring to the Wiki, you are getting spoiled for the rather pedestrian mystery - which should already be obvious since it follows the &#34;really popular cult actor shows up in a minor role&#34; pattern.This isn't a bad movie.

The scene takes place in the chapel of the boys' school where the entire film is set. Robert Preston (The Music Man), who plays Joe Dobbs, the headmaster of the eleventh-grade class, an English teacher much-beloved of the school's pupils, is standing at the front of the chapel, facing the altar. In a pew a few rows behind him is Jerome Malley (A Touch of Larceny's James Mason), the headmaster of the senior class, who teaches Greek and Latin and, as a holdover from the days when corporal punishment was accepted in schools, still has the nickname \"Lash\". Dobbs delivers a monologue that sets up the entire rest of the film, at least the bits that haven't already been set up. And I can almost imagine Lumet, at the end of that scene, smacking his fist into his other palm, pointing at Mason and Beau Bridges, the other main actor in this movie, then pointing to Preston and yelling, \"THAT is the quality of acting I want to see from you idiots!\"He gets it for the rest of the film.Plot: We open with Paul Reis (Bridges) as a senior at the school, on his way to see the headmaster, Father Mozian (They Might Be Giants' Ron Weyand), for the very, very serious infraction of drawing some obscene pictures on Malley's chalkboard. He's being escorted by freshman teacher Dobbs, who cautions young Reis that, while such actions may be amusing, they're not likely to get him anywhere in life. The camaraderie of the moment is shattered by one of the school's jocks lobbing a basketball at Reis' head--it would seem that Reis is what Jean Shepherd calls \"one of the nameless rabble of victims\" in A Christmas Story. Dobbs defuses the situation and everyone gets on with their lives. Fast-forward nine years. Reis is now a phys.ed. teacher who's sick of the public school system and has returned to his alma mater to take up a vacant position there. He and Dobbs pick up just where they left off, as great friends. Reis seems willing to bury the hatchet with Malley, but Malley is driven to distraction by his mother's imminent death, which he believes is being hastened by a series of anonymous, harrassing phone calls, and assaults on his own character (which include, but are not limited to, pornographic magazines being ordered in his name and sent to his home, as well as notes being passed by the students--it is never explicitly stated, but made obvious nonetheless, that all of this is homosexual in nature). We find out soon enough that Malley was supposed to retire at the beginning of the year, but refuses to do so because he is adamant that Dobbs not take over his job as senior headmaster; he considers the affable Dobbs not only unfit for the job, but in fact an agent of Satan himself (he believes Dobbs to be behind all the magazines, notes, calls, etc.). Reis walks into the middle of this, and while he's not explicitly tasked with choosing a side, his unexpected, and unlikely, ally Father Penny (King of the Gypsies' David Rounds in his first feature appearance), the oft-tipsy religion teacher, warns Reis that it's going to happen eventually, no matter how neutral he tries to stay. While this is the main conflict, there's also the ever-present bullying that, as we know, Reis is all too familiar with...but this class aren't just bullies, they're sadists; in the first act of bullying to which Reis is witness, by the time he manages to pull the children off, their target has damage severe enough that the hospital believes he may lose an eye. A second victim is mock-crucified, at which point Father Mozian is forced into considering whether to expel the culprits--which would, almost immediately, cause the school to shut down, as they comprise half the senior class (and thus, half the senior class' tuition). Assuming, of course, the authorities don't shutter it first.There is a great deal going on here, and the late Lumet manages to herd these cats very nicely once the movie finds its rhythm (which, admittedly, takes thirty-eight minutes). Mason, Preston, and Bridges, of course, were all known commodities by this time, and was there ever any question they were up to the material? As a simple portrait of the nasty goings-on at a boys' school, a generic slice-of-life drama, this would have been a damned good movie. But the final twenty minutes, which turn it into something very different indeed, take it from \"good\" to \"blow the lid off.\" In the hands of a lesser director, or performed by lesser actors (and to be fair, there's a time or two where it seems like Bridges is about to slip over the line), this could have come off cheesy, if not unintentionally hilarious. But it is meant to be horrific, and it succeeds. This is tragedy of Greek proportions, with the school's gang of bullies functioning as the chorus of harridans, and had the first thirty-eight minutes been as taut and compelling as the final hour, this would be Lumet's second five-star film in my library (Dog Day Afternoon is the other). Even with that considered, this is another guaranteed slot in the top thousand for Mr. Lumet; the brilliance of the last sixty-two minutes downright overwhelms the unfocused, muzzy quality of the first thirty-eight. **** ", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lumet's neglected masterpiece", "unixReviewTime": 1364169600, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2013"},

I like my sitcoms because they're easy to follow, even if you miss a week, and reruns barely ever get old (I think I've seen every episode of `Friends' twelve times over), but aside from that I really can't say that the idea of following a shows premise all season long interests me.  It's easy for me to miss a week and then find myself lost and wondering what is going on.  There are really just a few shows I've watched religiously; `The Sopranos' being one, another being the early seasons of `Nip/Tuck' (I lost faith after the disastrous third season).Well, you can add `The Riches' (as well as `Damages') to that short list.  As we head further into season two I feel compelled to write my review of the first season before too much blurs together.Like I said, following a show all season long seems like a daunting task for me.  When that show sinks its claws into you and refuses to let go though, you find it much easier to plop down in front of the TV every Tuesday night.  That's how things went for me with `The Riches'.  After deciding the `Nip/Tuck' was so behind me I needed to find something to fill that void.  I happened to stumble onto a encore showing of the pilot for this new `provocative' show called `The Riches' and within the first few minutes I was hooked.  Watching this cute little girl con someone then turn around and reveal that he was a cute little boy was enough for me; I was in.The shows premise is that of a traveling family (modern day gypsies), the Malloy's.  Dahlia has just been released from prison and her husband Wayne and three kids (Di Di, Cael and Sam) have come to bring her home.  Dahlia has her own set of problems, most instigated from the time she's just finished serving, but when Wayne decides that the life of a traveler is just not for them anymore the Malloy's find themselves in a hole heap of trouble.  Segregated from the rest of their traveling family, which includes Dahlia's crazy cousin Dale, the Malloy's find themselves on the run for their lives.  When an unfortunate accident costs a young wealthy couple their lives Wayne and Dahlia see this as an opportunity to change the course of their lives.  Taking on the identity of Doug and Charlene Rich, the Malloy's are now living the `American Dream', but is it really all they could have hoped for.The show at times may stretch the boundaries of reality, but that is what makes it so much fun.  The writers are smart enough to make what on the outset may appear implausible seem completely doable.  Looking at the situations Wayne and Dahlia find themselves and the ways they purpose to survive them is enthralling and exciting beyond belief.  What's so great about `The Riches' is that it asks the viewer to really examine what makes them happy.  As Wayne tries to turn his families life around and create a more stable and `normal' environment for his children he ultimately finds himself sacrificing the morals he has already set for them, and while Dahlia tries to support her husband she finds that her life is becoming more and more miserable by being someone that she doesn't want to be.  The children also have to adjust and decide if they even want to pursue a `normal' life if it forces them to change who they are inside.The acting is superb here.  Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver are phenomenal as Wayne and Dahlia Malloy.  Izzard has impeccable control and becomes the stability in the show, while Minnie steals every scene with her acting range and emotional temperance.  She conveys so much realism with her performance, it's captivating and touching.  All three actors who play the Malloy children are flawless.  Noel Fisher captures Cael's rebelliousness which is really nothing short of his outward display of disapproval with his parent's new lifestyle.  Aidan Mitchell is adorable as young Sam, the gender-bending son who can't seem to decide just who he really is.  But it is Shannon Woodard who really shines brightest here as Di Di, the smart and yet torn daughter who battles herself with their new life, wondering if it's perks outweigh it's disadvantages.Each episode is littered with superb supporting performances by Gregg Henry who plays Wayne's outlandish new boss as well as Margo Martindale who plays their nosey yet caring neighbor Nina.I can't think of a flaw here, at least not one large enough to deter anyone from enjoying the entire season.  Season two has now officially begun and is building strong on its first season so I truly only see good things to come at this point.  `The Riches' help make my Tuesday nights all that much more interesting and hopefully they can do the same for you.  Leave it to FX to create something new and exciting and completely worthwhile.

This season was so fresh and new in premise that I hung onto each episode.  It is great fun from first episode to last.  The premise is that Travelers (American gypsies or Roms) substitute themselves for people who were killed in a car crash.  They hid the bodies and then rolled into a moderate sized southern town as those people.  Since no one in the town knew them, they were able to pull this off.  The husband and father was a corporate lawyer and his wife was the perfectly tended 2nd wife.  The dead people had no children but they add on their 3 children to the mix.  These people have never lived in anything but an RV encampment and have lived on solely their wits for years.  They are expert con men, even the children.  Now they live in a gated community and must convince everyone in town that they belong.  It is always a near thing because, of course, they don't belong but they are excellent cons, both on a computer and off one. Wayne and Dahlia Malloy (Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver) are the husband and wife and parents of this bunch.  Eddie Izzard is a very well known British comedian and thus he is perfect for playing a man who has to live by his wits and become someone he's not on a moment's notice.  Although everyone else is very good, Izzard is outstanding and it is impossible to picture the show without him.

How in the world could they cancel it!? More people watched the premier of The Riches than ever watched an episode of the Shield or Rescue Me. It's also got to be one of the most creative shows I've ever seen! The show centers around the Molloy family, a family of modern day gypsies. Today is a big day for them as the matriarch of their family is being released from jail, after serving a two year sentence. A big party is thrown for her and all seems well in the Molloy family, but things aren't what they seem. The Molloy family is forced to leave their camp. Wayne (Eddie Izzard) is not going empty handed though. Before leaving he cracks the camp leaders safe and takes a substantial amount of money. Once on the road, they run into another family from camp, that had been oblivious to what was going on. It doesn't take them long to realize something isn't right, but before they can confront them, the Molloy's take off and a big highway RV chase begins. During the chase a passing motorist and his wife are killed. The man and woman are Doug and Shrine Rich, and they are on their way to a new home in Eden Falls. Doug was a savvy lawyer, who made a fortune at the expense of others. On this day he and his new wife were on the run also, moving away from everyone and everything they've ever known to move to a new state and into a new house they bought on the internet. Thanks to paper work in the car, Wayne Molloy quickly realizes who these people were and where they were going. It is then that he decides it's time to stop traveling the country and settle into a nice, normal, \"buffer\", lifestyle. Living in Eden Falls as Doug and Shrine. Along with their 3 kids, the Molloy's try to adapt from being a family of travelers to a family of wealth and stability. The show is amazing! There are so many twist and turns, cons and jokes, ups and downs, It's so well written, with an outrageous cast of characters, and most important of all, a storyline I promise you have never seen before!  The show was cancelled by FX in late 2008, but both seasons are available, and according to Wikipedia, Eddie Izzard and the show's creator are currently working on a full length feature film.

Season 1 it was Weight Gain 4000, Season 2 it was Terrence & Phillip in not without my Anus and so on, as with all seasons although you have the bad episodes, you always have your personal favourites but Season 11 is in my personal view the strongest and most unique season to date. With episodes ranging from racial controversy to a trilogy of episodes setting the boys in Imaginationland and ended up with its own DVD releases.Episode 1: With Apologies To Jesse Jackson: This is a Randy Marsh episode and shows the true no holds barred attitude that Matt Stone & Trey Parker have towards writing an episode. Randy is on an episode of Wheel of Fortune and accidentally uses the N word, which causes an uproar and singles Randy out as \"That N***er Guy.\" This episode is obviously a reflection on the American society in relation to the N word and satires the whole subject, extremely funny episode with some great one liners.Episode 2: Cartman Sucks: Again this is another controversial episode but this one is entirely around Cartman, of a night Cartman has Butters stay over at his house and while Butters is asleep, Cartman plays pranks on Butters then takes pictures of it. One prank backfires on Cartman which he's afraid will make people think he's gay, he thinks Kyle has the picture and is ready to show it to the class so Cartman enters on a panicky mission to try and save his skin. Amazingly funny as we see Cartman show some vulnerability.Episode 3: Lice Capades: One of the boys has head lice and Cartman leads a mission to try and find out who it is. Meanwhile in one of the boys heads one of the lice suspects that their environment will be aware of the affect the lice are having and may try to get rid of them. Now it's a race against time to try and convince the Lice that the environment wants to get rid of them. A great parody episode that shows the evil side of Cartman as he goes on this manhunt simply to make fun of the person with lice.Episode 4: The Snuke: One day while in class a young Muslim boy is introduced as the new student, Cartman becomes suspicious that he may be a terrorist and enlists Kyle to help him look into the background of this kid. In a 24 style episode Cartman unwittingly discovers a conspiracy to take down America and its government. This is possibly THE most controversial episode of them all as it made the news in England for the ending, the clear parody of Hilary Clinton is hysterical and makes this an enjoyable episode.Episode 5: Fantastic Easter Special: Stan starts to question the point of Easter which brings him into a conspiracy that has been kept a secret for 2000 years. A great parody of the Da Vinci Code that sees the return of Jesus in one hell of a cool setting and Kyle being Jewish has the opportunity to kill Jesus, will he do it? Enjoy this episode to find out.Episode 6: D-Yikes: Mrs. Garrison is dumped again and she takes it out on the class, the boys get sick of the constant screaming and ranting by Mrs. Garrison and they employ someone to help them out. A classic Mr./Mrs. Garrison episode with one hysterical ending.Episode 7: Night of the Living Homeless: Kyle is approached by a single Homeless man who's looking for some change, after giving the homeless man change more homeless people show up in South Park until it becomes an infestation. Cartman creates a goal for himself to jump as many homeless people as he can on his skateboard, while Kyle and the rest of the gang are on a mission to solve the Homeless problem. This is a great parody episode of Night of the Living Dead which gives yet another great part to Randy and shows how stupid he can be.Episode 8: Le Petit Tourette: One day whilst in a toy store, Cartman discovers something wonderful, something that he never believed that could be possible, he discovered Tourettes Syndrome. He sees a kid swearing and getting away with it and he decides that this would be a great excuse to insult those he hates to their faces and get away with it, little does he know however that him being Tourettes deliberately developes into something much worse which he didn't expect.Episode 9: More Crap: Another great Randy Marsh episode, in which Randy endeavours on having the worlds biggest poo, He's faced by some competition however, by the legendary number one at everything, Bono. I have to admit this is the weakest of all the episodes but it still has its classic moments, especially when Bono is in the picture.Episode 10,11,12: Imaginationland: One day Cartman is out to prove to Kyle that Leprechauns exist, the boys made a deal that if Cartman can prove they exist then Kyle must suck his balls. Cartman does manage to capture a Leprechaun but it was on a mission to deliver a warning to Imaginationland of a pending terrorist attack on our imagination. The boys are picked up by an eccentric man who takes the boys to Imaginationland which while they're there the terrorist attack takes place. Kyle, Stan & Butters enter on a mission to help fight the bad side of our Imagination and the terrorists, whilst Cartman sets out to prove that the Leprechaun was real so he can get Kyle to suck his Balls. An absolutely hysterical trilogy of episodes that show the genuine imagination of the South Park creators.Episode 13:  Guitar Queer-o: Stan and Kyle are the best players on the computer game Guitar Hero and they are signed by a record company who wants to display their skills by then gaining 100,000 points at a show in the arcade. Kyle gets manipulated by the record company and is convinced to get a new and better partner, Stan takes it badly and buys a new game called heroin hero in which he must chase the dragon. Again this is an incredibly funny episode that makes fun of those who take these games seriously and spend way too much time on them.Episode 14: The List: The girls of South Park elementary create a list of who they think the cutest boy in the school is. Kyle is placed last on the list but can't believe that he was placed lower on the list than Cartman, this uncovers a conspiracy that the boys would have never expected. It's a great episode that gives us a nostalgic look at some classic moments from previous episodes.As you can see from the descriptions this is a great set of episodes that everybody should own.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An Amazing Season", "unixReviewTime": 1214265600, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2008"},

Just when it seems SP has reached its peak, it keeps coming up with creative shows that cover the latest fads in our popular culture and sociopolitical consciousness.  Although \"Make Love Not Warfare\" from season 10 is still my favorite episode, season 11 provides another solid crop of classics, from the openings of \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\" and \"D-Yikes\" to the conclusions of \"Imaginationland, Episode III\" and \"The Night of the Living Homeless.\"Disc 1:\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\"--Who can ever forget Randy Marsh's faux pas on \"Wheel of Fortune,\" the way he apologized to Jesse \"the emperor of black people\" Jackson, and his fight to ban a hateful slur from society with the help of Michael Richards and Mark Fuhrman?  Meanwhile, a midget author who speaks at the school provides amusement for Cartman and an epiphany for Stan.  Instant classic.\"Cartman Sucks\"--There are several peculiar incidences in this season that put into question Cartman's sexuality.  This episode is one of them.  Cartman takes a picture with a certain body part of a sleeping Butters in his mouth.  When Cartman learns what such a photo means, he tries to take another photo with Butters to reverse it, but Butters's dad walks in on them and sends his son to bi-curious camp.  Of course, SP fans know Butters's dad has some bi-curious issues of his own.  Meanwhile, Cartman must make sure the offensive photos does not get out.\"Lice Capades\"--It is revealed that someone in Mrs. Garrison's class has head lice and the students turn vicious with suspicion.  Of course, SP can't just scratch the surface; if you will, it needs to dig deeper by covering a louse community destroyed by the shampoo treatment.  A lot of movie references in this one.\"The Snuke\"--A new student arrives in class who is a Muslim and immediately sparks Cartman's suspicions.  Turns out there is a terrorist attack planned, but not by Muslims--and it involves Hillary Clinton's unmentionable.  Clinton's voice makes her sound like a down home southern gal, not a Senator from New York.  I like how so much information can be found on the Internet and the blinking 12:00 on the \"24\" clock after the power goes out.\"Fantastic Easter Special\"--Stan questions what easter eggs and bunnies have to do with Christ's resurrection and learns about the secret \"Hare Club For Men\" (where do they come up with this stuff?) A Da Vinci Code style mystery is unveiled and Matt and Trey get back at the head of the American Catholic League who had been critical of SP and said some anti-Semitic things in the past.  Hmmmm, the papal mitre does look like it belongs on a rabbit.  \"Hippitus, hoppitus,\" indeed.Disc 2:\"D-Yikes\"--I love the opening to this one!  I remember when it was first aired I struggled to stop laughing after Mrs. Garrison storms into the classroom complaining about men.  This episode is one of the funniest SPs ever.  I like when Garrison announces she's gay and Stan replies, \"Again?\"  And the name of the lesbian bar is great!  I've never seen the movie \"300,\" but it's a takeoff on that.\"The Night Of The Living Homeless\"--SP is suddenly overrun with homeless people begging for change.  When the boys learn to mystery behind the onslaught of beggars, can they, with the help of some old school NWA & The Posse 8-Ball \"City of Compton\" style rap, save the day?Le Petit Tourette\"--Cartman sees a kid cussing uncontrollably in a toy store and learns that the kid has Tourette's Syndrome (is this a subject right up SP's alley, or what?!).  Cartman is given an idea that makes him so happy he breaks out in song.  Of course, his plan backfires when he starts blurting out things that, to him, are more damaging and offensive than \"%#@& #$!!*() #%!($#@@&/.\"\"More Crap\"--Randy Marsh passes a world record size BM.  when his record is broken, his life's quest is to get it back--but Bono is bound (if you will) to stop him.  I actually agree with the point they make about Bono, but this episode has a very nasty part--and I'm not talking about the BMs.Disc 3:\"Imaginationland\"--OK, the bet Cartman made with Kyle is hilarious.  I laughed to tears when I first saw it on TV, but what does it say about Cartman's sexuality?  Is that a prize a straight guy would want?  I mean, another guy performing the task?  What's up with that?  Anyway, the boys go on a trip to a land of imaginary characters--including my favorite, Pac-Man, though I don't like that he's sometimes given teeth--and it's hit with a terrorist attack.  Yes, terrorists have now attacked our imaginations.  Meanwhile, Cartman takes Kyle to court and Stan and Kyle are taken to the Pentagon for questioning.\"Imaginationland, Episode II\"--That opening dream sequence is from Monty Python.  The terrorists break down a wall and unleash the evil characters of our imagination and now imaginations are really running wild, especially when Cartman's demented Christmas woodland critters show up.  Stan and Kyle help the feds break through the portal to Imaginationland but, just before the troops charge in, Kyle may finally have to pay his debt to Cartman.\"Imaginationland, Episode III\"--With the help of Butters, the good imaginary characters set out to battle the evil ones.  Kyle has to stop the Pentagon from destroying Imaginationland before the good characters have a chance to win.  Al Gore, however, might doom everyone when he sees the evil character from his imagination.  Oh, and the Cartman/Kyle bet finally gets settled...sort of.\"Guitar Queer-o\"--Great!  In typical SP fashion, the importance of Guitar Hero is built up all out of proportion.  This episode shows how Matt and Trey keep up with the fads of pop culture.  I also like this episode because I'm a Kansas fan.\"The List\"--There's a list the girls created ranking the boys in their class from cutest to ugliest and Kyle is ranked last.  That can't be right!  Kyle is adorable!  Something must be wrong!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"Man, I do not want to meet the kid who dreamt those things up\"---Jason", "unixReviewTime": 1219190400, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2008"},

Durham \"Big Evil\"", "helpful": [31, 42], "reviewText": "Even in it's eleventh season, South Park manages to still be the funniest animated show on TV today.  Proof of that statement can be seen in the opening episode, appropriately titled \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\", in which Stan's dad Randy goes on Wheel of Fortune, and gets the wrong idea.  If you've never seen this episode before and are easily offended, well, I suggest you don't watch it.  For the rest of us though, this episode is worth the price of admission alone.  Not to mention the simply brilliant \"Imaginationland\" trilogy of episodes, as well as the very funny \"Cartman Sucks\" and \"Lice Capades\"; which once again find creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker not only pushing limits, but obliterating them.  Matt and Trey also have a fine time spoofing things as well, including 24 with \"The Snuke\", zombies with \"Night of the Living Homeless\", Bono's work (and their Emmy win) with \"More Crap\", 300 with \"D-Yikes!\", and the mega-popular Guitar Hero with \"Guitar Queer-o\".  The season really reaches one of it's best moments with \"Le Petit Tourette\", which finds Cartman faking having Tourette's syndrome.  While season closing episodes \"Guitar Queer-o\" and \"The List\" aren't anything too special, the season as a whole is still another winning and ungodly funny season of the long running show.  All in all, South Park continues to raise the bar for hysterical offensiveness, and we should all definitely be glad that it does, and hasn't become a stagnant shell of it's former self like another long running prime time animated series that will remain nameless.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still the funniest animated show on TV today", "unixReviewTime": 1212796800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2008"},

It contains great episodes and the only time they weren't of classic status was in Lice Capades. The episodes included in this set are:With Apologies To Jesse Jackson- Randy solves the wheel of fortune puzzle with the N word as he comes to understand why being classified by a word is annoying when it reminds you of a past you want to forget. (People who annoy you.)Cartman Sucks- Cartman gets Butter's sent to gay counselling camp as he tries to stop Kyle from showing the class provocative pictures of him. (Eric Cartman's mother called, she found the photo's)Lice Capades- A slower episode where the boys lice symbolize the annoyance we are as inhabitants to the planet. (Smart idea, poor execution)The Snuke- Hilary Clinton is under attack as Cartman plays the part of Jack Bauer in a 24 spoof. (The Snuke is in her Sn*tch)Fantastic Easter Special- Stan learns why we paint easter eggs in a Da Vinci Code Spoof. (Peeps!)D-Yikes- Mrs. Garrison finds a club for others like her but when Persians want to take over it turns into a '300' standoff. (Scissor me timbers).Night Of The Living Homeless- Great episode where homeless people play the part of zombies. (Does anyone have any change?)Le Petite Tourette- Cartman pretends to have Tourette's syndrome in an attempt to say whatever he wants. (P*ss! In your mouth!)More Crap- Randy breaks the world record for biggest crap until Bono steps in as the world's biggest piece of crap.(This show is emmy winning).Imaginationland I,II,III- The boys finally hit on the Iraq war in the most intelligent and entertaining thing they have done so far. Man Bear Pig, Al Gore and the Critterland Christmas Critter's all make appearances as well as Alien, Santa, Luke Skywalker and Jason Voorhies. (The terrorists are attacking our imaginations!)Guitar Queer-o- Stan and Kyle want to be rock stars but the life may be too difficult. (The best use of in show product advertisment since Make Love, Not Warcraft)The List- The girl's ranking of the boys looks finds them all reacting different ways in a more low profile still entertaining episode. (Burn it down, burn it down to the gwound.)The set is the same as all the previous ones with well chosen art work and safe DVD storage with easy access and convenient episode listings/descriptions on the box foldouts. Other than previews the only special features that have been on South Park sets recently are Matt and Trey giving mini-commentaries which are the most honest and entertaining commentaries around despite being under five minutes each.I loved this season, I feel it is has reached a new plateau for the series and hit a new stride creatively. South Park as a concept is a series that is constantly not only changing itself but evolving to keep current. The first two seasons were one thing then season three started it in a new direction through the fourth and fifth seasons. Then season six was similar to season eleven in that for me it hit a new stride and was near perfect beginning to end. The trend of the sixth season grew through the seventh and season eight was another new height for the series. The ninth season started it on a new track through the award winning tenth season to season eleven which for me is another solid season beginning to end (despite Lice Capades which had funny moments but didn't hold my attention, a few more moments of the boys might have fixed this).The recent South Park seasons have been better in the tail end or second run of episodes. I think since episodes are split up in runs from March to May and then September/October to December this is probably because they have more time over the summer to workout idea's ahead of time and improve what they didn't like looking back on the first half.The twelth season is coming out on DVD/Blu-Ray soon and it's not as great as season eleven overall but it is again the series moving in a new evolutionary direction and I look forward to seeing where it will be going next. If season eleven is a new highpoint then season twelve is a more than entertaining and satirical enough passtime until the show reaches it's next creative plateau.

Sarah gets points for the occasionally brilliant surrealistic humor, then loses them for her sheer idiocy. It's hard to like this person/character, despite her occasional genius.She is also very anti-semitic at times. But, she is also Jewish. Are Jews allowed to make nasty fun of Jews and also of manufactured anti-semitic hysteria? Anyone else would be declared a war criminal for making a joke about big noses...but apparently if you're Jewish you can go much, much much farther than that. At one point she even suggests the Holocaust was faked. How dare she? To the electric chair! But wait...she's Jewish...I would love to see more Christian and Buddhist and Hindu and Muslim and Jainist etc comedians who have this sort of egotistical self-loathing cushioned by loathing of everything and everyone else as well. But somehow we don't get much of that.Silverman says that's because the media is largely owned and run by and for the Zionists who make the US fight their wars while they run their banks and Federal Reserve, but she is Jewish, so she can say that. It's darn offensive, however true it may or may not be, and I think she should apologize. It does explain her getting to do a show this offensive, though, so maybe it all makes sense. Her boyfriend is Jimmy Kimmel, perhaps the least talented person on TV (quite a feat), so it all fits together in some arcane fashion.In any case, while there's some uniquely weird and funny stuff here, the poop that surrounds it makes it somewhat of a moot point.It ain't normal, so that's a plus.But it's also often so mean-spirited that it just ain't funny.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The bad overwhelms the good", "unixReviewTime": 1194134400, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2007"},

There were times watching this show that I laughed as hard as I have laughed at anything I've seen in recent years.  But there were also times when I was simply appalled at how unfunny and in bad taste some parts were, as if the point had ceased being to make us laugh and had become to shock and dismay us.  There are many moments when I am simply blown away by the brilliance and originality of Silverman's comic vision and times when I wonder if she has any conception of what is funny and what is not.This is definitely not a show for everyone and it has nothing to do with how well one's sense of humor is developed.  There are simply a lot of absolutely terrible moments in these episodes to go along with some hysterically funny ones.  If you can filter out or ignore the bad and merely focus on the good, this is a show you will either partially enjoy or consider a masterpiece.  But if you can't filter out the bad or if you obsess over the bad to a degree where you can't appreciate the genuinely funny bits, then you could well consider this to be one of worst shows ever concocted.I especially loved the initial episode, where Sarah buys some cough syrup that has a decided effect on her perception of reality.  That episode -- and especially Sarah's self-absorption that is so extreme that she almost obtains a childlike innocence -- reminds me very much of the balance that Paul Reubens was able to strike in PEE WEE'S PLAYHOUSE.  Unfortunately, she is not able to maintain that balance through the rest of the series.  I did not enjoy any subsequent episode as much as that one, though the one in which she thought she was dying of AIDS came close.  Here is a bit that presents the show at its best.  Sarah is feeling a bit down so she decides to go get an AIDS test so that she'll feel better when it comes up negative.  As part of the exam she is asked to respond to a questionnaire that tracks her lifestyle choices.  Here is a bit of that dialogue:Nurs:  Did you ever have a blood transfusion in the 80s?Sarah: Yeah.Nurse: (alarmed) You did? You had a transfusion in the 80s?Sarah: (bemused) Oh! Ha!  No--I thought you said in Haiti.Nurse: (even more alarmed) How long were you in Haiti?Sarah: Oh that's hard to say; I was doing a lot of heroin at the time.On the other hand, there are the truly awful moments, most of which cannot be repeated on a board like this.  It wasn't merely that they were off color or excessive or extreme.  They were simply not funny.  And being extreme simply for the sake of being extreme is not funny.  Andy Kaufman could pull that off, but few others.So, this is a show that can only receive a limited recommendation.  More perhaps than any other comedian today, Sarah Silverman invites extreme reactions.  There have been many moments where I have found her to be as funny as anyone alive and times when I can't tolerate her.  I suspect that this is pretty much what you will always get with her.  But I will say this:  there isn't anyone else out there quite like her.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "You'll either love it or hate it -- or both at the same time", "unixReviewTime": 1186272000, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2007"},

There should be more confusion and uncertainty going on in that small town more than anything else.

The mirror, hurts.Most poignant in the first episode is the narrow-minded mother who accuses the mayor of not knowing what it's like to have your kid 'out there', when in fact Jake is 'out there', and his dad the mayor, doesn't know if he's still alive.  But he has no luxury to think about that, to cry, to worry.But oh, that mother thinks she's supposed to yell at the mayor, to be a good mother.  Instead, she's not only a bad mother, but a bad human being, heedless of anyone but her own ego.  She obviously doesn't even care about her kids;  because if she did, she'd be trying to help, not yelling.Hope someone will redo the series, for we need to see how hypocritical, parochial and ill-prepared we are, to assemble and think through a crisis, always expecting someone else to handle it;  always uninterested in the big picture, uninterested in doing something ourselves, always ready to blame someone else, never paying attention.It was always 'cool' to pay little attention in school.  Only the bad guys run things.  To be disinterested in anything but one's narrow circle, is supposed to be a virtue.

The second was virtually unwatchable.Pros:The show is like \"Picket Fences\"PilotmeetsThe Road Warrior. You get the small town dynamics of folks who have generations of family and a lifetime of history then just to keep the storylines from getting too girly you have the whole post apocalypse thing going on.Likewise, there are the moral decisions that people must make. What is the correct action to take? What are the rewards and punishments for that action? In the end, the answers are ambiguous, just like life, but the struggle for moral truth - with all the history and entanglements that folks in a small town have - is almost as compelling as the struggle for survival.While I'm sure it wasn't intended, the series is a powerful endorsement of Federalism. A strong city government maintains order while the federal and state governments collapse. The fact that the city government succeeds is in large part to the small town history of relationships.Cons:If history teaches us anything, human society is surprisingly resilient. While things like Katrina, the Great Chicago Fire, and/or the Great San Francisco earthquake have caused localized destruction of society for short periods, within a few weeks or month's life reverts to normal. Social norms are resumed and law and order return. In WWII Germany and Japan, despite the general destruction of the nation and mass hunger, society more or less functioned.The U.S. is a country of 300,000,000 plus. It is geographically huge. I don't think 10 or 20 atomic weapons would result in a complete destruction of society. The plot addresses this by saying that Jericho was in the middle of nuclear fall out zones but spared due to unique weather patterns. Still, I would suspect that what is left of the United States would mount a heroic rescue effort of these isolated pockets. It just might take a couple of months.The whole CIA/terrorist storyline really doesn't add anything to the best parts of the show and actually distracts from it.Most of the corn in the U.S. is not edible by humans. It is grown to feed to livestock or to turn into corn syrup. I suspect that there would be a lot more hunger in Jericho.Realize that Kansas is tornado country, but found the number of people who had their own backup generators and stockpile of gas a bit unbelievable.Overall, if you can get past the parts that seem unrealistic, Jericho - especially the first season - is as good as network television gets.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "FIRST SEASON IS SUPERB, SECOND IS UNWATCHABLE", "unixReviewTime": 1381190400, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2013"},

Mom\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I have now come to that stage of life where I have seen every standard TV plot so many times that I am now able to predict the denouement almost as soon as I see the setup and have declared a personal embargo on watching any more shows about doctors, lawyers or cops. While some of the current offerings (House, Scrubs, etc) are quite passable - there are other occupations, and other situations which in the hands of the creative, will offer sufficient interest to keep viewers returning on a regular basis. Shows like \"Lost\" and \"Ugly Betty\" are splendid examples of what can be done by stepping outside of the cop-lawyer-doc box, and \"Jericho - Season One\" is another. Take an intriguing and (for television) a semi-original situation, involve a large cast of interesting people reacting to it and voila - something that will bring back the audience, over and over. Especially when it is a situation that we might imagine happening to ourselves. After 9/11, and Katrina (which provided the genesis of \"Jericho\" to its creators) it is all to easy to imagine what happens when the world we know suddenly ends, right in the middle of all our mundane plans for a perfectly ordinary day.Which is exactly what happens to the citizens of the small town of Jericho, Kansas, to the family of Johnston Green (Gerald McRaney) and their neighbors and friends. Jericho is a small, pleasant place, full of people going about their own business - farming, stocking the grocery store shelves, going through a mayoral election, planning a wedding and enduring an audit by a visiting IRS agent. The school children are off on a field trip and the Green's black-sheep son Jake suddenly appears needing a great deal of money - the only ripple in the pleasant still pool of a modern American life. In one of the most quietly effective sequences, the camera follows two children, playing hide and seek in a back yard, while one climbs on the roof of a shed, and then onto the house roof. The boy suddenly freezes there, silhouetted against the clouds and the sky - and then we see what he has seen; a mushroom cloud, coming up from a line of mountains on the distant horizon.And that is the exact point where the people of Jericho, and a handful of visitors who just happen to be there begin a long slow devolution from the twenty-first century into something that more resembles the frontier West... and then to a condition that looks more like the warring city-states of Renaissance Italy, or classical Greece. First they struggle to figure out just has happened to the rest of the country - and then begins the fight to survive, ending in a cliff-hanger which promises a large audience for the second-season premiere. It makes for a more interesting television show than I had thought, when I first heard about it. The first season set of 22 episodes is neatly packaged on 6 discs. Commentary and deleted scenes are included for selected episodes on the same disc. I would have much rather that deleted scenes be edited into the episode where they belonged, to make a sort of \"director's cut\", rather than having them tacked on as an appendage. The omitted scenes would have done a lot for the overall story; it's clear that they were omitted to shorten each episode for broadcast.Other extra features included a rather interesting \"making of Jericho\" feature, which included some actor auditions, and a look at set construction, and a short about disaster preparedness, which included some unintentionally hilarious 1950s Civil Defense footage on how one should shelter under a desk or behind some furniture in the event of a nuclear holocaust.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An Intriguing Premise", "unixReviewTime": 1243900800, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2009"},

The short version: I like JERICHO, and I recommend it. Now, here's the long version.SPOILERS, here and there, everywhere.Great, something nutty survivalists and I can agree on. So I really like JERICHO. It's a strong show and addictive, with a tantalizing premise that should geek out almost any casual fan. Today, end-of-the-world stories have become even more fascinating and timely. JERICHO nicely slides into that space, dropping a tale of fear and struggle and of survival and hope. JERICHO tells of frightened townspeople pulling together under duress and facing down each daunting obstacle. As it turns out, JERICHO is also about nuts. There's a memorable scene late in Season One regarding nuts, and even a real life, save-the-show campaign involving nuts.The story begins with residents of small town Jericho, Kansas glimpsing a shocking mushroom cloud blooming, off in the distance. Word rapidly gets out that Denver and Atlanta have become the targets of nuclear attacks, and who knows how many other cities were bombed? Very shortly after, Jericho, population five thousand, finds itself alarmingly cut off, with minimal and dubious contact with the outside world. In the following days and weeks, the town finds itself contending with a plague of challenges, from radioactive fallout to widespread paranoia to roving marauders to the inevitable arrival of shellshocked refugees from affected neighboring towns and cities. All too soon, the town's resources begin to peter out. Just how long can Jericho and its people hang on, before it all falls apart?The collapse of civilization has a way of leaving deep psychological scars. When stripped of the underpinnings of society and government, it's awfully hard not to become reduced to a caveman denominator. Jericho, influenced by its mayor and his sons, tries to cling to its pre-apocalyptic ideals. It makes for riveting viewing as Jericho's tiny geopolitical dynamics are shaken up and a new, more aggressive social culture emerges. It's a whole new world, a crappy, blighted one. The standard of living has devolved. Horses become a popular, fuel-saving alternative to automobiles. Windmills prove to be a seriously viable source of energy. Food is rationed, ammo is doled out, medicine is hoarded. Money loses value. Bartering is the new money. For Jericho, its salt mines provide an invaluable trading commodity. Meanwhile, the residents are still in the dark as to how widespread the destruction is, or if America still even exists as they know it.Despite the post-apocalyptic, sci-fi setting, JERICHO is fueled by human drama. The show doesn't make the mistake of forsaking storytelling for flash. Oh, there are taut action sequences here and there (\"Rogue River,\" \"Crossroads,\" & the final 4 episodes). And the ongoing suspense is there, even though the series commits itself to a slow burn, taking its sweet time in divulging answers (which probably threw off some viewers). But, mostly, the focus is on the characters' development and their personal story arcs, set in a world-gone-mad backdrop. Jericho is a tiny town, with its share of secrets and notoriety. Extramarital stuff goes on, and family conflict. Political wrangling goes on. A local crime lord lurks on the fringes. A secretive neighbor moves in. But Jericho is also a place where redemption can be earned, estranged families reunited, a sense of community galvanized, and a sweet but unlikely romance blossom between, say, a down-to-earth farmer and a prickly IRS auditor.The acting is very good, the performances, for the greater part, grow on one and impact in the emotional gut. It's a pretty hefty ensemble cast, but JERICHO gravitates towards the Greens, Jericho's first family and led by patriarch and town mayor Johnston Green (a wonderfully understated Gerald McRaney), who also happens to be an ex-Army Ranger. It's so nice to check in with McRaney again, as I haven't seen him since hisSimon & Simon - Season Onedays (I dug it whenever Johnston put on his cowboy hat). I like that he and Pamela Reed achieve a certain believability as a longtime married couple. Props also to the hissable Michael Gaston, who plays Johnston's scheming political rival Gray Anderson, a fella you can't help but throw middle fingers at. I'm not sure how much acting chops it takes to make your character so detested, but Gaston pulls it off. It helps that Anderson isn't nasty all the time, and, in fact, fervently believes that he's a guy doing the right thing, and, sometimes, he even does. Meanwhile, while Ashley Scott is a striking actress, I wish more screen time had also been given to the quietly vibrant Sprague Grayden, who plays schoolteacher/car mechanic/engineer/all-around cutie Heather Lisinski. I like her as much as Scott, with both gorgeous actresses flaunting a nice chemistry with lead actor Skeet Ulrich. On a minus, I wasn't digging Dale, that taciturn kid who works at the grocery store. The earlier shows made him a sympathetic character, but, later on, he transforms into an unlikable opportunist.But the two most interesting - and enigmatic - characters happen to be Jake Green and Robert Hawkins. Jake, effectively played by Skeet Ulrich, is JERICHO's stoic central hero and is the Green family's troubled black sheep who returns to town after five mysterious years of absence. No one's privy to what Jake's been thru since he went away, but, there's no doubt at all that his many newfound skills go quite a ways in keeping Jericho afloat in the trying times ahead. It doesn't take long before the townspeople start looking to Jake as their go-to guy. Another intriguing character is the immensely capable, new-to-town Robert Hawkins (British actor Lennis James, here sporting a Yankee accent), who passes himself off as a St. Louis cop (he's not). Lennis James does a great job of ambiguously toeing that line between good guy and bad guy, all the while exuding that dangerous vibe; you're just never quite sure which side he's on (I mean, even his family is wary of him). Regarding Jake and Hawkins, we don't really get the backstory until the episodes \"The Day Before\" and \"A.K.A.\"There aren't a lot of weak episodes here, with each one integral to the ongoing story arc and several being of the heartwrenching sort (\"Winter's End,\" \"Why We Fight\"). Episode 17 (\"One Man's Terrorist\") I wasn't too fond of, that one focusing on Emily's amazingly bland fiance Roger. But then the ensuing five episodes frenetically bring it home. In the months ahead, it'll turn out that Jericho, even with its assorted problems, had fared better than most other places. This makes the town a desirable target. This plays out in the last four episodes, culminating in the slam bang finale as Jericho is forced to go to war against an invading neighboring town. Season One's final episode \"Why We Fight\" ends on a cliffhanger, at which point, CBS pulled the plug on the series. And, boy, did that tick people off. But, thanks to the concerted efforts of its fans, who delivered thousands of pounds of nuts to CBS, the network greenlit a second season in the form of seven new episodes. And thank goodness! Seriously, a cliffhanger is NOT the way to go out!Sidenote: Here's a cool gimmick: Each episode features a different Morse code played over the title shot, which offers a hint of what's going on in that particular episode. I've got to learn Morse code.JERICHO - THE FIRST SEASON comes in a 6 disc package, and CBS doesn't stint on the bonus features. \"Building Jericho\" is the interesting 24-minute-long Making Of documentary, which includes snippets of cast audition clips (of Lennis James, Kenneth Mitchell, Pamela Reed, and Sprague Grayden). \"What If?\" is a sobering 9-minute segment delving into the history of the atomic bomb and the terrifying possibility of a nuclear attack today. You want episode commentaries? Or deleted scenes? You got 'em! Fifteen of the 22 episodes come with either an episode commentary or deleted scenes (or, sometimes, both). The commentaries are mostly by the executive producers (exec. producer/director Jon Turteltaub is actually kinda funny), although Skeet and Lennie James do pop in to drop their own words (Skeet in \"Rogue River\"; Lennie in \"Red Flag\"; Skeet & Lennie in \"Vox Populi\"). Would've been nice, though, to have commentary on the last episode \"Why We Fight.\" But, overall, not too shabby for extras.Now, if only the eyeball network can see fit to extend the second season beyond a mere seven episodes...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"There are some things the Apocalypse can't change.\"", "unixReviewTime": 1203724800, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2008"},

As time went on, people complained about lack of goods but it never really makes much of a dent.  The lack of gasoline, etc. is discussed but in the end it really doesn't affect the residents much.  Besides these concerns, I became more involved in the show and the realism of the setting didn't bother me as much.  Actors meld with their characters and they become more interesting and human.  Jericho in Kansas is a place where the bombs were not supposed to go off and be a safety zone for the terrorists who have detonated the bombs.  The residents don't know what went on and only gets bits and pieces as the series moves on.  The main characters are Jake Green, the son of the mayor who has been mysteriously absent for several years.  He seems to have been in Iraq as a soldier.  The other main character is Hawkins,  an African-American man who mysteriously appears with his family for unknown reasons just before the bombing.  As time goes on, Jake and Hawkins appear to be the heros who will save the day.  The series becomes more and more detailed and exciting.  I was impressed with the choice of great actors in the series including Gerald McRainey who plays the mayor, Pamela Reed as his wife and Lennie James as Robert Hawkins.  One of the most impressive things in the series is allowing Lennie James, a British-African actor. to rise up to be a star.  There aren't many black actors being allowed to act and participate in a show except as the buddy and Hawkins is a character who surpasses everyone else without argument.  The series only lasted a year and a half but if very impressive.  It began when the networks were attempting to challenge cable channels with higher quality series just as they did with Lost and Desperate Housewives.

The story centers on the events in the fictitious town of Jericho, Kansas, after a nuclear attack.  The immediate concern is survival, and then maintaining basic government structure, medical facilities, and utilities.  As characters are defined, past lives and secrets are disclosed, and roles, old and new, are formed.Exactly what happened is a mystery, and while some things are revealed, it is evident to viewers that there are several hidden conspiracies.  The situation gets more complex, as new characters appear, and a hazy picture of the new America slowly takes shape.The key figures in Jericho, are from the Green, Richmond, and Hawkins families.  The ensemble cast is great overall, but Skeet Ulrich's performance as wayward son come home, Jake Green is superlative, and the glue that holds much of story together.  Gerald McRaney as Johnson Green, the mayor of Jericho, brings incredible toughness and leadership, to a situation that demands it.  The wild card that separates Jericho from being just a post holocaust survival tale, is Robert Hawkins (Lennie James), a newcomer in town engaged in something very, very, deep.The writing is often clever and suspenseful, with unexpected developments springing up.  Although things begin slowly, the season finishes in a flurry, with the town on the verge of all out war.  Quite sobering, for a network television series.  The writers mix things up, using creative flashbacks, and bringing back characters, and even a tank, in later episodes.  While there are inconsistencies and illogical events, and some things have to be toned down for television, the story builds to a riveting conclusion, leading to a second season, that almost never was.  Family values, morals, and patriotism, are some of the values that led to the founding of America, and this series effectively touches back to them.Executive producers Jon Turteltaub and Carol Barbee provide commentary for a few episodes, and Skeet Ulrich and Lennie James, also contribute commentaries.  'Building Jericho' is a 24 minute documentary feature, about how the town of Jericho was constructed, and some interesting background information.

{"reviewerID": "A1CQGAPQMN41LV", "asin": "B000OJFV3S", "reviewerName": "A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "England, 1519. King Henry VIII rules England and is beloved by his people. His wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, is popular and the king's chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey, is able and formidable in administering the country and defeating plots against the throne. Another of Henry's advisors is Sir Thomas More, a man of great conscience and integrity whose respect and friendship the king values.However, it is a difficult time in Europe. The Lutheran heresy is raging unchecked in Germany and the Pope is unable to defeat it. King Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V are engaged in a deadly rivalry, both hoping to enlist England as an ally. With his queen - the Emperor's aunt - apparently unable to bear him a son, Henry also begins movements towards a divorce. When he falls in love with the beautiful Anne Boleyn, this matter becomes pressing and threatens a breakdown of relations with Rome.The Tudors is a television drama produced by the Showtime network and based on the life on Henry VIII, focusing on his relationships with his six wives and the political and religious turmoil that resulted. The first season covers a period of roughly eleven years, running from the accession of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor (in 1519) to the death of Cardinal Wolsey (in 1530). However, real historical events are compressed, combined or moved around in the timeline to read better as part of the drama. The contentious marriage of Charles Brandon to Henry's sister Mary Tudor (slightly confusingly changed to Margaret in the TV series) happened in 1515, but is moved to later on to create an interesting mid-season subplot, for example.The Tudors plays fast-and-loose with the details of real history, but like HBO's Rome before it, the show does succeed in getting across the events and complications of the period. The complexities of Henry's relationships with fellow European rulers and the Pope are recounted well, as is the seething tension within the English court. As a very rough introduction to the history of the period, The Tudors works, though those interested in the real events are referred to the many history books about the time.As drama and narrative, The Tudors is something of a mixed bag. The script is inclined towards the expositionary, with surprisingly little incidental flavour, and what there is is often questionable: a scene showing Henry VIII composing 'Greensleeves' is amusing but also cheesy and highly inaccurate (Henry VIII definitely did not write the music to the song and his authorship of the lyrics is questionable, at best). One of the strongest episodes in the season is the one where England is ravaged by disease, as it shows how Tudor England coped with such disasters and features more incidental scenes of life amongst the common folk than other episodes.The acting is mostly good, with the likes of Nick Dunning (Sir Thomas Boleyn) and Henzy Czerny (the Duke of Norfolk) providing able support. Henry Cavill (Charles Brandon and, more recently, the latest actor to play Superman) is good as one of Henry's few true friends, though he arguably may have made a better Henry VIII himself. Maria Doyle Kennedy gives an excellent performance as Catherine of Aragorn, mixing palpable fear and worry over not being able to give the king an heir with pride and anger at the thought of being set aside. Natalie Dormer is given the hard job of portraying Anne Boleyn, the woman a king plunged a nation into anarchy for, and almost pulls it off. She is hamstrung by the indifferent script, especially as the story skips large chunks of their courtship and the precise reasons for the king's fascination with her are left somewhat ambiguous: in the TV show she simply appears to play hard to get, fascinating the king who normally just has to nod his head to get a woman into bed with him. Given their seven-year courtship and the intensity of Henry's feelings towards her, this feels rather inadequate as an explanation.Central to this first season is Sam Neill, who plays Cardinal Wolsey with just the right mix of intelligence, political scheming and ruthless anger. Wolsey is presented as something of an antagonistic figure, but he is also shown to be a caring family man (Wolsey had a wife and two children) and to be utterly devoted to the king. As Wolsey repeatedly fails to get the annulment Henry wants, he becomes more desperate and Neill portrays Wolsey's descent with passion and intensity. Neill is possibly the highlight of the first season. Jeremy Northam also gives an excellent performance as Sir Thomas More, highlighting both More's well-known piety, intelligence and integrity but also his darker side, such as his commitment to burning heretics and Protestants at the stake.Where the series falters - and it's quite a big misstep - is the casting of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in the central role of Henry VIII. Eight years prior to The Tudors, Rhys-Meyers had played the coldly cunning role of Steerpike in the BBC's adaptation of Gormenghast, and bizarrely he seems to be playing Henry VIII in much the same manner. The real Henry VIII is noted for his charisma and vivaciousness, his force of personality sweeping up those around him. Whilst Rhys-Meyers certainly nails the king's intelligence, confidence and raging temper when thwarted, his performance is also often cold, desperate and occasionally whiny. I can understand the idea of subverting the traditional image of the fat, middle-aged Henry VIII by showing him as a young man in the prime of life, but Rhys-Meyers simply fails to get across the complexities of the real historical figure.Fortunately, this is not quite as disastrous as it might be supposed: The Tudors may be about Henry VIII, but the series follows those around him more than the monarch himself, and the emphasis is on the court and period as a whole rather than on the one man by himself.From a technical viewpoint, the series is well-directed. The use of CGI to flesh out the castles and stately homes of England is interesting and rather ahead of its time (and makes up for the fact that the show was filmed in Ireland, with limited or no access to some of the real locations portrayed in the series), though also sometimes distracting. Early in the season we have relatively brief camera shots of locations that try not to dwell on their computer-generated nature. Later in the season we have rather distracting rapid camera movements and broad shots of locations which are clearly CGI and artificial (and whilst the CGI is good for 2007 and the show's limited budget, it's still not great), creating a bit of a dissonance once we switch to the live-action scenes.The first season of The Tudors (***) is flashy, fun and enjoyable but also lightweight. The lack of historical accuracy is not a major problem - the show at least portrays the real events, if not always in the right order or with the correct details - though the uncharismatic performance of the lead actor and a sometimes indifferent and flavourless script certainly are. Luckily, most of the other actors are excellent and as a rough introduction to the time period and events, the show does work.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "File under 'guilty pleasure'", "unixReviewTime": 1370649600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2013"},

Mom\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Out of all the reigning monarchs of England and elsewhere whose lives would have made a smashingly entertaining soap opera, that of Henry VIII is generally acknowledged to be at the top of anyone's short list. The man certainly had a way with serial monogamy, and as such has kept writers like Philippa Gregory, movie-makers, playwrights and the BBC busy for decades. Make that centuries, for even Shakespeare had a go. One would think there isn't another blessed thing that could be said about the much-married monarch, and yet Showtime has managed it. And they haven't even gotten up to the point where he had finally and irrevocable divested himself of his first wife and married the second - in the process almost casually wrenching England out of the orbit of the Catholic Church. This season just sets the stage and establishes the personalities.In one way, this reminded me rather vividly of the movie \"Elizabeth\", in that it combined psychological acuity with considerable historical inaccuracy. Yes, there are all sorts of inaccuracies, merged events, death of historical personages that did not occur for years after the events depicted here, deaths that did not in the least happen as represented here, and strikingly divergent  visualizations of personalities - not least of which is Henry himself.This is not the usual Henry VIII, a heavy-set and peevish middle-aged man; here he is vital, young and passionate; a sort of rock-star king, as charming as he is - perhaps - a sociopath. He is the sun around which the whole of his court and government revolve. Jonathan Rhys Meyers looks nothing like the historical Henry. However, he conveys the arrogant attraction of the man and his single-minded pursuit of his desires, whether it was victory on the tilt-yard or in a diplomatic convocation... or to be rid of a wife who could not bear him a son. One has the sense that yes, Henry VIII was probably very much like this; charming, mercurial and dangerous to cross - and that his court was a snake pit of seething ambitions and relentless plotting to gain his ear and his favor.Eventually Henry would be also be rid of anyone around him who dared to tell him \"no\", and that is what is the larger drama in this first season: the downfall and disgrace of his most trusted adviser and chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey (Sam Neill) and the setting aside of his proud and able wife, the Catholic Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) in favor of the younger and presumably fruitful (and Protestant) Anne Boleyn. This is the point which has been reached in the series finale, although for my money, the most noteworthy climax was that moment of quiet horror when Thomas More (Jeremy Northam) and another councilor seemed to realize that there was absolutely no one left at court who would be able to reason or coax Henry out of the disastrous course that he had set.Of the extra features included in this set, the most interesting is a look at series production and sets, and a tour of modern-day sites in London associated with Henry VIII's court.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Rock-Star Monarch", "unixReviewTime": 1243900800, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2009"},

It is good however to see the King be himself and the energy that he brings to the character.  The customes and sites seem to have been well done also.  I'm however not a big fan of explicit disregard for his wife and daughter despite Henry's \"caring\" about her.  It might have be the thing to do at that time but it irritated me everytime.  He was in a room with his wife, the Queen and the mistress Anne is there as well.  He's suddenly so in love and can't live without her.  He wants to divorce his wife because the marriage was supposedly not legal.All of sudden after all the one nighters with women he probably can't even remember or name if put to the test.  His focus should be more on running the country and all the other issues that the people are having around him, not chasing after a woman (that has more skeletons in her closet than a cemetary).  While i enjoyed Johnathan Rhys Meyers acting in in this for the most part and he's very likeable guy.  I can't help but hope that the story picks up for this series.It has some promise and i hope that the Tudors can deliver on that in the 2nd season.

It's a fascinating study of a subject I really knew very little about and I come away feeling more informed somehow, and entertained into the bargain.  Even if religion isn't your thing, religion and politics were once quite married and intermixed with the state and it's fascinating to see these things portrayed - and to compare them with where we are now.

I thought the show was visually appealing, but way too melodramatic and historically inaccurate for my taste. However, I recently read a fascinating book about Henry VIII, and I needed something else to satisfy my Tudor fixation. I watched all the episodes of \"The Tudors\" On Demand in less than a week, and I really enjoyed them.In order to appreciate this program, you have to be willing to accept the show for what it is. Yes, the majority of the characters and plots in the show are based on real historical events, but this is a cable television series, and of course things are going to be changed to appeal to a larger commercial audience. As a result, all of the people in King Henry's court are much more attractive than they probably were in real life, and there are some major alterations to historical timelines. Still, I'm impressed that the producers actually did get so many things right with the show, and overall, it's very engaging to watch. The pacing is exciting and fast...perhaps a little too fast, in my opinion. For example, Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Blount gets knocked up with Henry's illegitimate child in the very first episode, and by the second episode, she's already giving birth. I wonder how long \"The Tudors\" can realistically continue to air with such a rushed chain of events.For the most part, I think the casting of the show is excellent. I've never been a big fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers until now, but his portrayal of Henry VIII is intense, dramatic, and exciting. Sam Neill is brilliant as the two-faced Cardinal Wolsey, and Natalie Dormer is perfect as the bewitching Anne Boleyn. As far as the characterizations of these famous characters goes, I think Henry VIII has been a bit one-sided in Season 1. I'll be interested to see how Meyers tackles the role when Henry finds himself betrayed by the woman he nearly sacrifices his kingdom for. It would be nice to see a more emotional side of Henry. Also, I think Anne has actually been pretty likable so far...hopefully she'll become a much darker character in Season 2.Overall, I enjoyed \"The Tudors\" much more than I thought I would.

The timespan is a small one, from his growing discontentment with Catherine of Aragon, to consummating his love for Anne Boleyn... so we only get to wife number 2 - plenty of scope for sequels, but did leave me with a bit of frustration at times wanting to see a little more resolved.As it is, the key players here are Henry VIII, in his low 20's, fighting fit and clearly horny (there are some fairly explicit scenes towards the beginning of the season).. Cardinal Wolsey (played with great presence by Sam Neill) the corrupt but efficient First Minister, and Sir Thomas More, the fervent Catholic and conscientious humanist.The series thrives on a combination of terrific performances, well written screenplay and flawlessly depicted Tudor atmosphere of the Court.It falls short of Rome's success by failing to have a counterpoint to the Royal drama - the scenes of `Real' England, the bars and backstreets, are only rarely seen, but could be considered vital to understanding the England of the times.  Having some lowly characters in situations of poverty, may well have helped accentuate the drama.Having said that, and despite a few forgivable departures from history, this works well as a refresher on Tudor history, and is a first at seeing Henry VIII in his prime as a real human being.Kudos to Showtime, and I await the next series with bated breath..Extras are modest, but rewarding - a couple of 5 minute featurettes on costume and sets, and a lengthier one with a tour guide taking us round the real Tudor historic sights in London, all moderately interesting.  A documentary depicting the real history may have also been a welcome addition, but is lacking.Also included are first episodes on some other Showtime series - a cunning plan, and a welcome one.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Henry 8th's Younger years..", "unixReviewTime": 1209168000, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2008"},

Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars as King Henry VIII, whose sexual appetites are only matched by his desire for power and to ultimately get his way.  The only person in his court that matches his desire for power is his closest advisor, Cardinal Wolsey (Sam Neill), who Henry's subordinates Brandon (Henry Cavill), Norfolk (Henry Czerny), and George Boleyn (Nick Dunning) seek to remove from power.  Involved in their plans are Boleyn's daughters, specifically Anne (Natalie Dormer) who catches Henry's eye and becomes a thorn in the side of Henry's wife Katherine (Maria Doyle Kennedy).  The performances are great, the production is grand, and as a whole, The Tudors is thoroughly entertaining and engrossing.  It lacks the epic feel that say, HBO's Rome, manages to weave; but the potential here is high for the show to become something special indeed.

Henry VIII, King of England is known to most as a man who broke from the Catholic Church to become Head of the Church of England and marry six women. Such infamy secured him a place in history, but so was the fact that it was his daughter with Anne Boleyn - Queen Elizabeth I, who was one of the most benevolvent rules of her time.  In any case, season 1 has four DVDs that will entertain you for almost 12 hours.  Perfect time to watch it would be this holiday season.  I was suprised that series had so much sex in it but also the twists and turns about historical background for Henry's decision-making and his pick of the closest advisors on his court is something I wanted to understand better.  Writers do get sloppy towards the end of the series and the language is not as sophisticated as one would expect it to be on the Court of one of the greatest kings of his time.  I find Jonathan Rhys Meyers to be excellent in his role, but perhaps too young to play a king married for 20 years to Queen Catherine.  Maria Kennedy who play Queen Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England is graceful and dignified.  Unlike the actress Natalie Dormer portraying Anne Boleyn.  Ms. Dormer is too coarse and unsophisticated in her role for a someone (like Anne Boleyn)who was witty enought to keep Henry's interest for so long,speak fluent French after being at the French court for many years.  This portrayal of Anne Boleyn is not befitting of a woman who was a mother of one of the most influential queens of the british royal history.  Court politics, intrigues and the switch of loyalties will keep your attention.  The lessons learned are the ones that apply event o today's modern times and that is perhaps the one more reason for having this series so popular.  I cannot wait to see season 2.

As the Protestant Reformation sweeps Europe, the great question is whether England will remain Catholic, under the Pope's authority, or whether the King's authority shall predominate in England.  King Henry VIII settled this matter for all time, at a time when religious authority truly mattered to the conduct of national affairs in Europe.This series is dazzlingly presented, with fine acting and a gripping, if somewhat leisurely, storyline.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers turns in a bravo performance as King Henry VIII--his intensity in the role is vibrant and convincing.  Sam Neill, as usual, is particularly fine as English Cardinal Wolsey, the King's Chancellor and confidant.  Along with Meyers he dominates Season One.  All of other the key roles are splendidly cast, and the sets are lavish; this is a beautiful production.Season 1 takes us from Henry's ascension to the throne, during which he gains confidence in his role of King of England and head of state--to his love of Anne Boleyn and his rejection of the queen.  The viewer sees in action Machiavelli's admonishment in The Prince that it is deadly to cross a Prince, and dangerous to be his friend.This series is eminently watchable and a great introduction to a critical period in European history.

The demented, righteous and corrupt Lt.

It was a senseless death, uncalled for...Lem spent most of the fifth season coughing up blood and drinking Pepto Bismol over the stress caused by his decision to \"take one for the team.\"But in the world of all great Shakespearean tragedies / Greek dramas, it was the necessary catalyst for Shane's ultimate fate in the final season.In Season Six, we also get Vic's Stike Team \"replacement,\" Kevin Hyatt. I think we pretty much know coming out of the gate that Hyatt is a weasel (as is more than abundantly evident from his post-one-night-strand behavior with Paula Garces' officer Tina Hanlon, but we also see it much earlier in the season). We also see the irony of Forest Whitaker's \"Kavanaugh\" meeting his final downfall for becoming Vic in order to take down Vic, and Wyms (CCH Pounder) fall to the same behavior as she lies to Vic upon Hyatt's entry in order to keep him on board in his final days, believing he has a chance at keeping his job (he doesn't).

Bob Hope is loyal to his wife but a misdialing of the phone gets him mixed up with a sexy movie starlet(played pefectly by Elke Sommer).  The rumor at the time in Hollywood is that Hope had requested to make this film with her as co-star.  I can't confirm that, but seeing the film, you could understand if he did.The film is pretty amusing and if you are a Bob Hope (or, to be honest, Elke Sommer) fan, then grab this.

That sight alone on two of the lead females was worth the price of admission.

While having little more to do than show her body, deliver a few accented lines, and be somewhat manhandled in closeups unsuitable to a stunt double, Elke Sommer still more than earned her pay by just being second banana to Hope. Phyllis Diller, a frequent support player to Hope in his various comedy venues in those years, does her particular thing well. True she was an acquired taste, as they say, but in this film, she does provide some fun. The remainder of the supporting cast do what is required of them to give the star his laughs. Hope, himself, nearing the end of his film career, has better material and, therefore, more laughs than some of the other films he made as it became only a marginal activity to being America's favorite comic here and abroad. At this time, he had something like one-third of the twenty all time hit shows on TV with his specials devoted to his entertainment of the troops, most recently in Viet Nam, where a bitter struggle was rapidly escalating.So for many good laughs, no irony or wit, no character development, no symbolic meanings, a story line just strong enough to carry the sight and sound gags, I can, still laughing, recommend this as feather-light, totally escape, viewing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the Best of Hope's Late Films", "unixReviewTime": 1273968000, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2010"},

Bob Hope (1903-2003) got his start in vaudeville, and enjoyed a successful career in radio and on the stage, and became a huge star in film and on television.  In the movies, Hope's style was usually characterized by fast talking, witty repartee, and generally being light on his feet.  After teaming with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, in The Road To Singapore (1940), the first of the seven \"Road\" pictures, Hope's career elevated to new heights.In chronological order, the films in this collection are They've Got Me Covered (1943), The Princess and the Pirate (1944), Alias Jesse James (1959), The Facts of Life (1960), The Road to Hong Kong (1962), I'll Take Sweden (1965), and Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966).  A quick summary of the films follows:They've Got Me Covered (3.5 stars)Set in Washington D.C. during World War II, Hope plays a newspaper reporter who is on the trail of some Axis agents who are trying to implement a nefarious plan.  Dorothy Lamour co-stars.The Princess and the Pirate (3.5 stars)Bob plays an entertainer on a ship bound for America, who gets tangled up with a princess (Virginia Mayo), when the ship is captured by pirates.Alias Jesse James (3 stars)Set in the American West, Hope is an insurance salesman who sells Jesse James (Wendell Corey) a life insurance policy, and then has to try and make sure that no harm comes to the infamous outlaw.The Facts of Life (4 stars)Comedic legend Lucille Ball co-stars with Bob in this sensitive and funny drama about marriage, love, and fidelity.  Not to be missed.The Road to Hong Kong (2.5 stars)The final installment in the \"Road\" series finds Hope and partner Bing Crosby involved in an out of this world escapade, as Russians agents send the pair on a rocket trip to the moon.  Joan Collins co-stars.I'll Take Sweden (3 stars)Hope is a father worried that his daughter (Tuesday Weld) may marry the wrong guy.  He takes her to Sweden to derail her wedding plans, but once there, both father and daughter find romance heating up.Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966) (3.5 stars)Elke Sommer plays a starlet looking to get away from it all, who gets a misrouted telephone call from a real estate salesman (Hope), which instigates a kooky escapade that threatens to break up two marriages.These seven films illustrate that while Bob Hope's unique comic style evolved through the years, in many respects, it remained essentially the same.  Ranging from Westerns, to swashbuckling tales, to wartime adventures, to the close of the Crosby era, to coming to terms with the beatnik generation, the affable guy with the quick wit, endless quips, and ski slope nose was there to entertain.  As this set has apparently gone out of production, getting a copy may unfortunately be a difficult and expensive proposition.Due to a glitch at Amazon, this set and the film Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number are linked as being the same product, so this review is listed for both products.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "a nice selection, and fine introduction to Bob Hope's movie career...if you can find it", "unixReviewTime": 1325980800, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2012"},

What's best about The Closer are the characters we all love starting with Brenda Lee Johnson with that Georgia drawl, her flirtatious affair with FBI Fritz Howard and as ever the priority crimes team led by wise cracking senior detectives Flynn and Provinza. (I miss all those snappy one liners Provinza came up with on the Closer---the pair are more serious on the new Major Crimes...it's just not the same)Lt. Tao who is computer savvy and loves all the high tech stuff, Buzz who does all the crime scene video taping and prisoner interrogation's, Lt. Sanchez who always refers to his fellow officers as &#34;sir&#34;, and the rest of the crew. This was a top notch series, with great acting, well written snappy story lines, and was always very entertaining. I always loved the episodes when Brenda's parents visited and they always fit in Christmas episodes during the holiday season.

The extras although not overwhelming great are solid but then you really aren't buying this for the extras are you? We get a good featurette that talks about the art of interrogation where police officers discuss how they often get confessions and how they have to do the exact roleplaying that we see on the show. We also get deleted scenes for a number of episodes as well as a gag reel. Unfortunately there aren't any commentary tracks (the strong two part episodes would have been perfect for commentary tracks since they are both the most complex and, in the case of \"Next of Kin\", comedic (Brenda, Fritz, Provenza and a suspect have to travel cross country to return to L.A. during the Holidays with Brenda's amusing parents).I did run into a glitch with the second disc where the disc was either defective or there was a problem during the transfer where \"frames\" are skipped during an entire 10 minute segment (although the dialog is fine).As with the previous seasons the writing, direction and acting are top notch better than a lot that we see on regular network TV.

Based on the autobiography of George (Cary Grant) and Anna Rose (a dreadful Betsy Drake), the philanthropic foster parent poster-people, ROOM seems to drag a bit at 88 minutes ... but it is the children who truly make this film a delight. I'd never seen this film before and that made it the more interesting to watch.George and Anna Rose fostered several children - though they did not adopt them, preferring to rely on the welfare of the day to help them raise the children. A lot of this film is an interesting but shallow look at the system as it was in the 1950s. One is struck by how seemingly cruel the whole country was back then.Jimmy John Wilson (a spectacular Clifford Tatum, Jr., who fell off the radar in 1956), a boy in iron leg braces, steals the show as he recovers and struggles with having a family. The culmination is his shedding of the braces and joining the Boy Scouts. Of course gravel-voiced little Teenie (the famous little George Winslow), a kind of slightly more vocal Buster Keaton type, really steals the scenes. He blurts out something he shouldn't; when confronted with all the angry glares, he shrugs and says flatly, \"Shoot me.\"Also impressive was Ben (a very talented Larry Olsen), a warm-hearted average kid with a dry, keen sense of humor. Somehow he manages to slip a hilarious, inoffensive gay joke in his dialogue - you'll have to watch for it since I refuse to spoil.This an all-around 1950s classic of sorts, but do not look to the sets or even the director for that mark of excellence: it's all in the kids.

A Solinas \"ea_solinas\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Apparently the little genius town of Eureka hasn't quite run out of disasters yet, even with the destruction of the Artifact.In fact, Eureka's problems get worse as the show's writing becomes better, starting with the citizens bursting into flame. The second season of \"Eureka\" is more confident and well-balanced than the previous one, and it takes the characters, quirky humor and tight writing into brand-new territory. Including Carter walking around naked.The timeline has been restored, and Carter (Colin Ferguson) and Henry (Joe Morton) are trying to adjust to their past lives. Carter also is convinced that the future will unfold just as it did in the other timeline.But during a solar flare viewing, a guy violently combusts -- and soon other people start combusting. Carter searches for a link between the victims, and finds that someone near him may be next. Meanwhile, the Pentagon decides to remove Nathan Stark (Ed Quinn) from Global Dynamics' big chair, and replace him with his estranged wife Allison (Salli Richardson-Whitfield). My, that's awkward.Other problems pop up over the season -- shared dreams, personal forcefields, \"ice funnels of death,\" falling debris clouds attracted to the GD headquarters, invisibility projects, Fargo's frozen grandpa, Biblical plagues, Carter becoming unnaturally attractive to all women, and an attempt to recreate the Big Bang that apparently turns everyone (except Carter) into driveling idiots.But while the Artifact has been effectively destroyed, its presence is still felt -- Allison's autistic son Kevin has formed a strange connection to it. And when a brilliant scientist creates a deadly alchemical bacterium -- which turns all iron into gold, then rust -- it may lead to a showdown over Kevin's future....There's a darker current running through the second season of \"Eureka\" -- Henry is more subdued and haunted, and a little boy's life is in danger. But don't worry, because thankfully the writers don't switch too far into the dark zone -- the focus is always first and foremost on our Everyman Sheriff, and how he tries to deal with the Horrific Crisis of the day.In fact, the second season flows very easily, with a more relaxed pace and a colourful, diverse array of science-based problems -- including robot geese. There's lots of great dialogue (\"Jo made it seem like the sky is falling.\" \"That hasn't happened since 2004, and that was more of an igniting of the ionosphere\") and hilarious comedic moments, such as Carter's naked public shower and the shared Zorro fantasy. But there are some sweet moments too, such as Fargo's grandfather coming to terms with the life he missed out on.I wasn't too impressed by Ferguson in \"Eureka's\" debut season, but he really gets to blossom in this one -- he's quirkier, cuter and has a knack for physical comedy. He fits in better with the Eurekans. And he brings a lot of life to Jack's problems, whether it's the weird stuff, or the more realistic threat of his ex-wife taking his daughter out of Eureka.Quinn and Richardson Whitfield also do well, as Allison and Nathan try to adjust to their new positions, as well as some renewed sparks. And the other characters get rounding out -- Jo gets in touch with her inner girly-girl, Zoe clashes with some genius \"mean girls,\" Taggart has a maternal experience, and Fargo gets in touch with some family members. Also has to deal with the possibility of dying.Of particular note: Morton brings a feeling of dark pathos into many of Henry's appearances, reminding us what he's lost and leaving us wondering what he's planning. And it's worth noting that a trio of \"Stargate SG-1\" actors make some very solid guest appearances -- particularly Michael Shanks as an embittered, myth-obsessed scientist.The second season of \"Eureka\" sticks to the humorous sci-fi angle, but expands the characters -- as well as some of the darker subplots. Definitely a great little series, and promises to stay fun and suspenseful.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Today's forecast calls for heat, frost, rain, hail, gale force winds and severe lightning...", "unixReviewTime": 1212278400, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2008"},

Sure, it's pretty formulaic, but that's part of what makes it so good... it's familiar, and comforting, and the formula just plain WORKS.Unfortunately, the resolution on this DVD is not very good (it's old technology, after all), and it's not available on Blu-ray.

It has been a long time since a new Sci-fi as fantastic as this one and one which has not been dumbed down for a change. This is a technology buffs dream come  true. Plus it is a clean, wholesome program for the entire family. It never fails to engage your attention and teach you something new using technologies so advanced, it is new to all of us. Every episode has been wonderful. The interaction between the cast members has been magic. Congrats to the person who selected the cast.It was a stroke of genius to start their new series in July each year. Eureka was the only game in town as far as new TV programs at that time of year. Seems none of the other Cable channels have caught onto the fact that we also watch TV in the summer.We are happy to see Henry back to normal. The writers had almost ruined his character between the dark moody scripts and changing hairdo's. Henry is one of their main characters whether they like it or not. His many talents make him a multifaceted character which never fails to surprise us.Oddly, I thought I never liked the character of Stark until they killed him off last Tuesday in a real tear-jerker ending. Now the show seems empty without his egocentric abilities. A key necessity in such a lab of high tech covert projects. I liked it better with him in it. They need to bring him back... perhaps by finding out that he was thrown into the future rather than deleted.I know shows will get rid of expensive actors and trade them for a couple lesser actors.... but the trade-off of Stark for Thorne and the new sister of the Sheriff are not even close to the same caliper as Stark and neither adds anything to the series. The new additions are just excess baggage. It would be no loss if they both disappeared.As far as Thorne's trimming of the employees role... The gov't has never cared about how much tax money they waste..and they don't usually lay off their black project scientists... so her coming in and acting like it is a private corporation needing to be slimmed down makes no sense.Not to mention why the Sheriff's sister would be allowed to be in a closed town filled with black project employees and scientists who use classified products out in the open.This looks like an early attempt to cut costs. In the corporate world, you're allowed to show a loss on your taxes for 3 years. After that, they lose the tax breaks so most new companies will start trimming employees between year 2&3 and will usually pick their highest salaried employees to cut and try to replace them with someone cheaper... unfortunately, they usually end up with someone who can't do the job... which is why they are cheaper to hire.They need to let the viewers decide on major cast and plot changes... not some pitbull exec in the network sales dept... like the ones who canceled Star Trek and Outer Limits.Let's hope some idiot in charge doesn't cancel or ruin the spirit of Eureka like they have managed to do in the past to every decent show. Especially those programs which are over the heads of those cable network goons. They need to remember that most viewers are not on Nielson and they are not getting accurate ratings from them. They should also be careful about allowing a sponsor to ruin the program with too much interference... and Degree is coming close to that point in just a few episodes this yearBut so far, Eureka is still a one-of-a-kind program which never fails to entertain and bring delight to the viewers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best new sci-fi in many years", "unixReviewTime": 1219276800, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2008"},

The main character, Grace Hanadarko is a completely unlikable character with very few redeeming qualities. She is in a down spiral into self destruction (and hell) and she does everything in her power to hasten it. A cop, Grace has many inner demons. She is very promiscuous and uses sex and alcohol to escape her inner demons. Sex, adultery, alcohol and violence, that is Grace's life. She is a good cop though and, although a bit violent on the job and an affair with her married partner, she has an interesting sense of justice and a desire to get the criminals.One night, while drunk driving, Grace hits a man and in a moment of desperation asks God for help. Well, God answers in the form of Earl, her own Guardian Angel, her last chance at redemption. Well, Earl is far from the traditional angel with wings, he is a scruffy looking, tobacco-spitting, and rather sketchy looking angel. He tells Grace she is headed straight to hell and that this is her last chance. Earl provides Grace with guidance and clues to something that she has to figure out (the big reveal of the season). Through Earl and the rest of the cast, we delve into the inner psyche and past of Grace, a deeply troubled and scarred woman that has suffered through many things including the death of her sister (Oklahoma bombings).Grace's self destruction is even more interesting when we learn that her brother is a priest, her sister is a perfectionist and a bit OCD stay at home mom and her best friend (San Giacomo) is the voice of reason in more ways than one and offers unconditional support. The way all these characters are contrasted against Grace provides a very interesting view of Grace herself and whether she will straighten out. Although I dislike the show and I dislike Grace, one must admire the multi-layered and complex character that Holly Hunter plays with perfection. Truly, her acting skills shine through and although I hate the show, I can't help but watch.

Of course as far as I know, he's also the only one.But that doesn't stop the second season of \"Psych\" from being a rollicking good time, full of crazy schemes and baffling murder mysteries. James Roday and Dul&eacute; Hill actually become even more entertaining, with less slapstick and more of a reliance on eccentric plot twists, pop culture references, and crimes that get ever weirder.Shawn (Roday) and Gus (Hill) get swamped by reality pop culture when American Duos comes to Santa Barbara. The cruel British judge Nigel St. Nigel (Tim Curry) hires them to protect him, because he thinks that someone is trying to kill him.A live wire and a poisoned sandwich later, Shawn agrees -- especially when a drugged-out female judge almost dies. But out of all the people who loathe Nigel, which one tried to kill him? Then the police suspect that Shawn has lost his touch when he announces that someone was killed by a dinosaur, and is confronted by a sexy FTD psychic.But that isn't the last or least of Sean and Gus's problems -- a chop shop with secrets, bounty hunters, Gus's parents accused of Yuletide murder, jockey deaths and fixed races, nanny-related robberies, electrocutions on the catwalk, and going undercover at a telenovela, a school for the gifted, and a retirement community. They even have a run-in with a wealthy, crazy woman that Gus drunkenly married on spring break years ago... and it turns out her new fiancee is a bit shady.Finally, Shawn and Gus are pursuing one of their weirdest cases ever. First a security guard is suspected of stealing a 3000-year-old mummy -- but then it appears that the mummy actually murdered the guard. Can Shawn figure out what is going on -- with the mummy murder, the police chief, and his oddly-behaving father?Although it didn't break much new ground, the first season of \"Psych\" was very fresh and entertaining TV. Fortunately creator Steve Franks is sticking to the old adage: \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" and the second season doesn't deviate from what works -- there's still lots of comedy, spoofery, silly dialogue (\"It's spontaneous psychic krav maga!\") and enjoyable mysteries.The first episode kicks things off a bit weakly, since the \"American Idol\" joke gets stretched out too far. Fortunately the mysteries after that get much more solid, deftly juggling even the funny-sounding plot twists (strangulation by mummy bandage? Refrigeration trucks?). You even get an endless parade of pop culture references, from Michael Jackson to \"Shaun of the Dead,\" James Bond to wikipedia.com. Gotta love that.But the best aspect of \"Psych\" continues to be its kooky dialogue. Usually Shawn provides it (\"I hunger for the meatballs the way a jackal salivates for an injured possum\"), but other characters get to as well (\"Hola. Me llamo Inspector Carlton Lassiter. Me gusta queso\").Shawn and Gus remain an entertaining pair of twentysomething everymen, with Roday continuing to be eccentric, lovably charming and kooky -- although Shawn gets quite a shock in the cliffhanger ending. And Hill gets more attention, with Gus pursuing models and faking psychic powers. We even discover a secret past involving sweater vests, spring break, and a drunken wedding -- lots of fun.And the supporting cast remains solid -- Corbin Bernsen gets to participate in a couple of the cases as Shawn's hard-nosed dad, sometimes in loud tropical shirts. Timothy Omundson continues to be entertaining as harder-nosed cop Lassiter. And Maggie Lawson rounds off the cast as the \"enigma wrapped in a little blonde riddle\" who is Shawn's love interest, as well as a counterpoint to Lassiter.The second season of \"Psych\" continues the eccentric crimes and equally odd crimesolvers, mingling comedy and mystery with only a couple weak spots.

Shawn Spenser (James Roday) comes from a long line of cops.  But he rebelled against his father's (Corbin Bernsen) wishes and didn't become a cop.  Instead, he pretends to be a psychic, using his finely honed observation skills to get the information for his \"visions.\"  He's even opened Psych, a psychic detective agency with best friend Burton \"Gus\" Guster (Dule Hill).  And he has an impressive track record, much to the dismay of Detective Lassiter (Timothy Omundsun).  Rounding out the cast are Santa Barbara Detective Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Interim Chief of Police Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson).And what a collection of cases they have this year, too.  Shawn and Gus join the TV sensation American Duos to find out who is trying to kill the head judge (played by Tim Curry).  They become models to find out who killed both partners of a fashion house.  Shawn must clear Gus' parents of murdering the neighborhood crank.  When Gus' uncle (guest star John Amos) comes for a visit, Shawn and Gus have to switch places, without the police figuring out that both of them are faking it.  Equally complicated is a case where a real psychic is brought in and Shawn must keep his secret from her.  Shawn puts his credibility on the line by claiming one victim was killed by a dinosaur.  And in the season finale, Shawn pins the crime on a mummy.This show has real come together and is firing on all pistons now.  The mysteries are tight and confusing.  I might piece things together a little before Shawn, but not by much.  And it doesn't matter because the entire fun is getting to the end.  The over the top physical humor has been toned down this year (and that's a good thing), but there is still plenty of laughs.  You've got cultural references spewed in mile a minute dialogue by Shawn and Gus, comedy from the character's relationships, comedy from the situations, and some physical humor.  I can't stop myself from laughing out loud while I watch this show.  And the cast does a great job holding it all together.

A Solinas \"ea_solinas\"", "helpful": [54, 60], "reviewText": "It must be admitted that the fifth season of \"Monk\" had some rough patches, where Monk's OCD was overwritten and the plots got a bit limp.But the obsessive compulsive detective is still going, and fortunately \"Monk\" is still one of the best shows on television. And the sixth season continues \"Monk's\" grand tradition -- solidly-written mystifying stories, quirky detecting, and some excellent acting from Tony Shalhoub. Even better, the two-part finale really shows \"Monk\" off at its absolute best.As the season opens, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) finds that his obsessed groupie Marcy Maven (Sarah Silverman) needs to hire him, despite a restraining order. So she \"buys\" him at a bachelor auction and makes him work on a bizarre case -- her dog is being accused of killing someone, but the dog died before the murder took place. Needless to say, there's more than meets the eye.Among the other cases the OCD detective has to deal with: a framed rapper, murder on a nudist beach, an investigation overlapping with Julie's love life, stolen safety-deposit boxes, treasure maps, a daredevil who might be his archnemesis, insomnia, going undercover in a cult, a newfound painting hobby, and a shot Santa. He even has to investigate Stottlemeyer's (Ted Levine) girlfriend.But the story takes a darker turn toward the end of the season. Monk finds a lead for the \"six-fingered man\" who killed Trudy, and confronts him... and after a struggle, the six-fingered man is dead. A rural sheriff arrests Monk, but Monk insists that he's innocent -- and he's determined to find out who is framing him. But with the police after him and a conspiracy in motion, can he solve the murder before he's caught?\"Monk\" had a bit of a rough patch in the fifth season -- some of the episodes simply didn't gel, and Monk's OCD was written strangely. Fortunately \"Monk - Season Six\" goes back to what makes the series more enjoyable -- a couple of episodes don't work, like the rapper and the creepy little cult, but these are overshadowed by the better mysteries.Nope, most of the sixth season is a string of solid murder mysteries -- lots of baffling crimes, obscure clues, and new eccentricities for Monk. Despite all the murder and bittersweet moments, the episodes are peppered with some comedy as well, such as the slow demolition of Stottlemeyer's brand-new car. And there's still plenty of bittersweet (\"I'm going to be buried next to Trudy. I can't wait\") and/or hilarious dialogue (\"She had the oldest profession.\" \"Stonemason, huh?\").And the last two episodes of the sixth season are among the best the series has ever produced. A seemingly straightforward crime story blossoms into a heartrending, suspenseful, dramatic, and genuinely unpredictable story, and gives us a few more clues about Trudy's death.Tony Shalhoub is lovably oddballish as Adrian Monk, never turning his tragicomic character into a cartoon -- you just want to hug Monk and give him some perfectly symmetrical cookies. Traylor Howard does a solid job as Monk's assistant, and Levine gets to show Stottlemeyer's warmer, laid-back sides, while Jason Gray-Stanford is consistently fun as the puppy-eager Randy Disher -- even getting to sing a Johnny-Cash-style song about Monk's apparent demise.The sixth season of \"Monk\" has a couple rough patches, but soars up to brilliant heights near the end.

A Solinas \"ea_solinas\"", "helpful": [87, 97], "reviewText": "Sherlock Holmes, Columbo, Hercule Poirot -- genius detectives are usually a bit quirky. But no other is as quirky as Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive detective -- and \"Monk: Complete Series \" compiles every episode of this funny, likable little mystery series. Tony Shalhoub shines as title character, solving the case with his gift/curse and his willingness to go anywhere... that doesn't have germs.Adrian Monk's wife Trudy was killed in a car-bombing, and the devastated detective fell apart completely. Years later, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is partially recovered, but he still is obsessive-compulsive and has dozens of phobias. The only way he manages is with his assistant Sharona (Bitty Schram) -- and later her successor Natalie (Traylor Howard) -- babysitting him.Courtesy of his friend Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine), Monk is called in for dozens of bizarre, baffling cases. His excellent memory and his OCD (\"It's a gift.... and a curse\") allow him to see patterns and details where other people see nothing.Among Monk's cases are going undercover at a prison, a killer dentist, a deadly Christmas gift, an elephant used as a lethal weapon, a billionaire mugger, saving Willie Nelson from a murder rap, trapping a black widow, the death of a 115-year-old man, the Mafia, garbage strikes, rock concerts, a cult, real estate, a murder on a sub, a voodoo curse, UFO sightings, martial-artists, murdered models, and a guy who leaped out of a plane -- and died by drowning.But as quirky and bizarre as the cases is, it never stops hitting the heartstrings. Monk becomes attached to a little boy and a murder victim's dog, and it's a credit to this show's writers that the ending of those episodes aren't maudlin or sappy. And he is still passionately devoted to his dead wife, and his quest for her killer is a story that stretches across the whole series.\"Monk\" is the sort of show that usually gets cancelled after five episodes -- it's well-written, amusing, and smart. So by TV standards, lasting eight seasons is nothing short of miraculous. Like any long-running show it has its duds (\"Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine\" always makes me cringe), but overall it's a brilliant series.There are gunfights and SWAT teams, like on any cop show, but the main focus here is on detecting. And the writers are skilled at coming up with all sorts of bizarre or unsolvable crimes, which only Monk could unravel. Not to mention the dialogue, which leans heavily on dry humour (\"So you're saying the opposite of a spider is a tall building?\")But the series wouldn't be what it is without Tony Shalhoub. He played weird roles in movies like MIB and \"Galaxy Quest,\" and so he knows how to balance out Monk's weirdness and genius without leaning too heavily on either. When told to sit on the ground, he says nervously, \"I can't. Animals do things on the ground. Terrible, terrible things.\"Schram and Howard are both good as his assistants, and they're similar without being TOO alike -- one was a hardened New York gal, and the other is a rebel rich girl with a checkered employment past. And Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford round off the cast as genial cop Stottlemeyer and his earnest (if slightly goofy) sidekick Disher.\"Monk: The Complete Series\" shows us all of this excellent show, with its uniquely appealing hero.

Monk didn't end it's run from bad ratings , instead fans were happy to see tony shaloub play this character for another 8 seasons. But he was tired of it so the show left the air with the central mystery finally solved. the early episodes featured bitty scram,  she was a excellent aide and did a great job as monks nurse aide. She wanted more money and was fired after a few series. this is a common mistake that many actors make. Only it's worse for women. roles for men are many. there's FAR less for women and a actress on a hit show shouldn't bail unless she has another real offer. this happened to terry farrel on 'becker' and she hasn't worked much sense. tony was well known for 'wings',one of the best of the 1990's sitcoms in the u.s. and a worldwide hit. You can see the show on reelz network in hd today. here he is the lead character and he creates a really sympathetic compulsive detective. ted levine is excellent as his friend capt stotelmyer.

Three years earlier, Adrian Monk's wife, Trudy was murdered by a car bomb. He has extreme O.C.D. and relies on his Nurse/Assistant Sharona to help him while he solves murders with Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, and Lt. Randy Disher. Throughout the season Monk investigates an assassination attempt on a Mayoral Candidate, goes to an asylum, takes a vacation, deals with an earthquake, helps prove the innocence of Willie Nelson, and much more.Season 2- Monk's 2nd is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous season, perhaps even better. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his Assistant, Sharona. Throughout this season Monk investigates a murder at Trudy's high school, goes to Mexico, help prove the innocence of Sharona's sister during a stage play, figure out why a paperboy is killed for the newspaper, gets married, goes to jail, and finally gets a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 3- This is probably my favorite season. During the course of this season, we say good-bye to Sharona Fleming and hello to Natalie Teeger. Monk investigates Warrick Tennyson's role in Trudy's murder, gets fired, helps an organized crime family, becomes a contestant on a game show, gets stuck in traffic, goes to Las Vegas, adopts a kid, and much more.Season 4- Throughout this season Monk returns home on HALLOWEEN, stays in bed because he's sick, gets drunk, goes to a fashion show, figure out who would want to poison Stottlemeyer at the Christmas party, gets amnesia, stop a killer astronaut, and figure out if Trudy Monk had faked her death.Season 5- Throughout this season Monk deals with a garbage strike, loses his eyesight, attends his college reunion, goes to a rock concert, finally meets his dad, goes on the air, and much more.Season 6- Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 7- Monk is forced to find a new therapist because Dr. Kroger has died. Throughout this season Monk matches wits with a chess player, helps a boxer, gets stuck on a submarine underwater, meets his other brother, fights City Hall, and much more.The Final Season- In the end, all the pieces will fit together. Throughout this season, Monk serves as a bodyguard for his favorite actress, investigate a UFO sighting, goes undercover as a Mafia boss, celebrates his Birthday, receives a surprising visit from Sharona Fleming, and finally solves the murder of his wife, Trudy.

Gordon", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generallythe blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problemand I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there wasa slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhapsit was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefullyit seemed more a reproduction problem.This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but acceptas an artistic decision.Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might wantto make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the bestyou can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the laterdiscs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too lateto ask for an exchange.None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode theoccasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wifenever noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).As far as getting the individual seasons on blu-ray, it looks as thoughyou can do better buying the box set, although prices fluctuatequickly here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I'd advise you do the mathand figure out the most reasonable way to own the complete set.Also, Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray boxset for about $100 with shipping.  It seems to have all the same extrasas the US box set.

This isn't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show. It combines an in-depth story arc, top-notch acting, realistic special effects, and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.Unlike Star Trek, BSG tries to depict a gritty, realistic vision of humanity's future. In the first few episodes, a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies, leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy. The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.Amongst the main characters, the acting ranges from good to excellent. In particular, Edward James Olmos as Admiral Adama is absolutely amazing at conveying the burdens of command. I first saw Olmos as Detective Gaff in Blade Runner and never could have imagined him as the star of a TV series, but he really shines. Mary McDonnell as Laura Roslin also wins plaudits as perhaps the most convincing female president ever portrayed on TV.I love some of the individual episodes from Season 3. Starting off the season with much of the crew forced under Cylon occupation was brilliant. We get to see the characters really put through the ringer. And they change. There are some really compelling moments. One of my favorite episodes focuses on labor disputes in the fleet. It's a small glimpse into life for the hoi polloi in BSG, but it really makes you ponder what life would be like under such circumsances.That said, Season 3 is the point at which BSG really started to jump the shark for me. While I liked the idea of beginning the series with part of the crew under Cylon occupation, the Cylons just don't work as the main villains. I still haven't gotten over the idea that they're perfect imitations of people. However, in Season 3, the Cylons just leave any pretense of being machines. They act like people in all but name. They have petty jealousies, fall in love, and argue amongst each other. Worst of all, several of the episodes follow Gaius Baltar on a Cylon base ship and there's a \"love bed\" on the ship! A bed with bright red sheets and plushy mattress just for Baltar and his Cylon women. I definitely started getting sick of the Cylons by this point.Overall, I love individual episodes of BSG, but I don't like where Season 3 is taking the larger story. Individual episodes can have great character moments or engage in deep moral questions. However, when character and morals take a backseat, the series flounders. Still, it's definitely must-see television for sci-fi fans.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "gritty sci-fi at its best", "unixReviewTime": 1356480000, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2012"},

Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.The third season represented a bit of a transition to something atouch more surreal, a little odder, which would pay off fullyin the last two seasons.

In fact, \"BSG\" just may be my favorite television show of all time, which says a lot!Season Three of \"BSG\" picks up right where Season Two left off. The majority of people have been living on New Caprica for more than a year and are trying to build new lives for themselves. Unfortunately, the cylons eventually managed to track the humans down. After invading New Caprica, the cylons convinced President Gaius Baltar to cooperate with them. Now people live in constant fear of the cylon occupation. Resistance leaders including Chief Tyrol and Colonel Tigh continue to fight the cylons and attempt to come up with an escape plan, which is a very hard thing to do since both Adamas and their respective ships jumped away from New Caprica as soon as the cylons invaded. Obviously, the Adamas and their small crew can't just abandon the rest of humanity, and an elaborate rescue attempt is planned.I don't want to reveal too many details about the season and spoil things for people who may not have seen it yet. However, there's a lot that goes on in Season Three, especially where Tyrol, Tigh, Tory, Anders, and Starbuck are concerned. If you thought the Season Two finale was shocking, just wait until you see what happens at the end of Season Three!There are a few small issues I have with this season. First of all, I think there are too many \"one-shot episodes\" that don't really seem to advance the main plot of the show at all. Having a few episodes like that is fine, but I think there were an abundance of them this time around.

Tight loses his wife, and Starbuck loses her emotional stability at the hands of the Cylon occupiers.  The colonists on New Caprica are then rescued by a carefully orchestrated surprise mission by Pegasus and Galactica, and the series goes back to the search for Earth.  In between, Starbuck is killed, and then comes back to life; and Balter is imprisoned on a Cylon ship, then imprisoned on Galactica.  We also have 4 of the 5 humanoid cyclons revealed, along with President Roslin's re-acquintance with cancer.  So overall, a very eventful season.  Probably the high points are the dialogue, of which numerous scenes stand out.  Some of the best include Apollo's defense of Baltar at the latter's trial, Six's explanation of projection to Baltar while on a baseship, Ellen's defense of herself to Tigh, Starbuck's taunting of numerous other people, and Romo's elaborations of justice and the legal system.  The script itself has numerous holes.  Probably the biggest holes are in the early episodes on New Caprica.  The cylons clearly have the technology to monitor the entire range of electro-magnetic, thermal and acoustic radiation, yet they resort to tent-by-tent search and seizures of colonists.  these glaring plot holes continue throughout the season and conclude with the trial of Baltar in the last 2 episodes; Cross-Roads 1 and 2.

{"reviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "asin": "B000UU4IX0", "reviewerName": "Robert Moore", "helpful": [21, 27], "reviewText": "Warning! The following contains spoilers. If you haven't seen Season Three and want to remain spoiler free, do not read this review.Season Three of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was the most debated and controversial yet. Much of the controversy stemmed from the number of hot button political topics it addressed. What other show would take several major characters we know and love and have them execute another character we had known from the beginning of the series for collaborating with the enemy, demonstrating in the process the extreme danger to justice inherent in independent military tribunals (disturbingly similar to the ones that the Bush administration has advocated)? What other show takes up the logic and ethics of suicide bombing by having \"us\" attack \"them\" by the death of another semi-recurring character in an effort to kill recruits for the local police force? Many of the episodes outraged those on the political right, as the parallels with the situation in Iraq was, despite efforts to minimize the resemblance by references by creator Ron Moore in interviews to Vichy France, became increasingly blatant. To his credit Moore, a member of the left but a self-admitted Rush Limbaugh listener, has not had the show lean too heavily to the left for most of the show's run, but in the season's first several episodes that balance fell away. And in the most controversial episode of the season (debated on Internet boards more passionately than I can ever remember any episode of any show) the question of whether genocide against a murderous enemy is justified, pitting several of the major characters on the show against each other.On the other hand, Season Three had several surprisingly uninspired episodes. All of these were of the \"stand alone\" variety. All of the \"mythology\" episodes (to use the X-FILES terminology that Ron Moore himself often uses) were outstanding. In posts on boards, podcasts, and interviews Moore has said that most of these episodes are produced by the insistence of the network. The thinking is that having nothing but arc episodes intimidates potential viewers. But the brute fact is that at this point in the series it is a sheer impossibility for anyone to start watching at this point. This is the beauty of DVDs. Anyone who wants to watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can by buying the DVDs, borrowing them from a friend, downloading them from iTunes, or renting them from Netflix or their local DVD rental store. Bizarrely the networks don't seem to have comprehended the ways that viewing patterns have changed.Season Three is structured around the Cylon occupation of New Caprica and the ongoing effects of that occupation following the rescue of the humans by Galactica. Many of the characters on the show never quite get over their experiences there, in particular Tigh and Kara. Interpersonal conflicts that were created on New Caprica, especially between Kara and Lee, take much of the season resolve, and the whole New Caprica experience doesn't really come to an end until the close of the trial of Baltar in the season finale. In one way or another the experiences there color almost everything that happens during the season.Instead of summing up individual episodes or talking about the major story arcs, I would like to highlight my ten favorite moments of the entire season.1. The Adama Maneuver: During the rescue on New Caprica Adama gets crucial Vipers into the fray by jumping into the upper atmosphere of the planet. Since Galactica cannot fly in an atmosphere, they launch the Vipers as the ship plunges in a fiery ball towards the surface, jumping again just a couple of hundred feet before smashing into the earth. It is - and I say this with little fear of contradiction - the most extraordinary special effect in the history of TV. No one who has seen it has been able to forget it. It is inconceivable that the show won't win the Emmy this year for Best Special Effects (but then, it is impossible to see how they lost to LOST and its black smoke effect last year) and when it does, this is the special effect sequence they will show at the awards.2. Leoben has imprisoned Kara in a living situation that parodies that of a married couple. As they dine Leoben stands beside her and tells her how beautiful she looks. She smiles and rams a pair of skewers through his neck, kicks him back and falls on his chest stabbing him repeatedly. She returns to the dining table, takes a bite, then daintily dabs at her mouth with a napkin, oblivious to the blood that covers one of her hands.3. The death of Jammer: In \"Collaborators\" several characters we've known and loved kill Jammer for being a collaborator during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica. We've known Jammer since Season One when he, Cally, and Socino tried to make a still. But that doesn't prevent him from being shot out an airlock. Nearly as good was the near execution of Gaeta later in the same episode.4. Five great Sharon moments. This is a total cheat, but here are five great moments involving Sharon in Season Five. 1) The last time we saw Sharon in Season Two she was deeply distrusted from not having told Galactica about Cavil being a Cylon. She had told Helo that she wanted nothing to do with him or anyone on Galactica. Our first shot of her in Season Three, her cell door is open and we see it filled with comfortable furniture: a desk with books, an end table and coffee table, wall hangings and curtains, a comfy chair, and a large and extremely comfortable leather couch. Adama is sitting beside her drinking tea and he tells her that he feels all alone, except for her. Clearly in the previous year, somehow Sharon had become just about Adama's closest friend. 2) Because of the new trust Adama has in Sharon, she becomes an officer in the colonial fleet. Through the rest of the season she repeatedly tells others - whether human or Cylon - that she has given the fleet her word and she intends to keep it. Though some doubt her, Adama's faith in her is repaid repeatedly in the season. 3) Sharon enters the Cylon Detention Center on New Caprica to recover the launch keys that are crucial if the humans are to escape from New Caprica. She gets interrupted by D'Anna Biers, who tries to tempt her into coming back to the Cylons with the news that Hera is still alive. Sharon responds by putting a bullet into both her D'Anna's knees. She walks away, saying \"Adama wouldn't lie to me\" (and it turns out he didn't, since he didn't know that Laura stole Hera and faked her death). 4) Sharon and Boomer come face to face. One of the season highlights had to be the show's two major Number Eight's meeting. The irony is intense, since at the beginning of the series Sharon was completely on the side of the Cylons and Boomer was with the fleet, unaware that she was a Cylon sleeper agent. Now, however, Boomer like D'Anna before her tries to convince Sharon that she doesn't belong with the humans. Her reply is to the point: \"I made my decision and I know where my loyalties lie.\" 5) Boomer does, however, tell Sharon that her daughter is still alive and is on the nearby Cylon basestar. After Adama confirms with Roslin that Boomer's story is true, Sharon rescues Hera by talking her husband Helo into killing her so that she will resurrect on the Cylon resurrection ship. Only seconds after reaching Hera she plots her return to Galactica. The irony is that only a few minutes earlier Roslin was dressing down both Helo and Adama for their faith in Sharon. Knowing that Sharon is downloading into a new body she tells them, \"And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain. And you as well, Admiral.\" What is wonderful is that Laura states all this as if it is in doubt. But less than an hour later Sharon is back on Galatica with Hera. Oh, and Sharon is given her own handle: Athena, a nod to the original series in which Athena was Adama's daughter. And in this one Sharon has become one of his surrogate daughters.5. \"Exodus, Pt. 2\": I said I wouldn't summarize any episodes and I will resist doing that here. But this episode, which contained \"The Adama Maneuver\" I mentioned above, is easily one of the two or three most unforgettable episodes in all of BSG. At the end of 2006 the well-known Internet TV website The Futon Critic issued its annual list of the Top Fifty episodes of the year. With total justification they named \"Exodus, Pt. 2\" the number one episode of 2006, not just of BSG but of all television shows combined. It was that good. Four beats made it stand out. First, Saul Tigh's killing of his wife Ellen for collaborating with the Cylons, second the Adam Maneuver, third, the rescue of Galactica by Pegasus and its destruction, and fourth, Kara learning that Leoben had lied to her by telling her that Kacey was her daughter.6. The fight between Kara and Lee in \"Unfinished Business.\" In the Season Two finale we learned that somehow Lee and Kara had fallen out with each other so completely that they were barely able to talk to one another. In this episode we get that back story. Adama has called for a series of boxing matches to air out grievances that crew members feel towards one another. We see Lee and Kara's story intercut with their pounding on each other in the boxing ring, learning of the night of passion that they spent with each other and their declaring their love for one another, and of Kara's sneaking off and marrying Anders the next morning. As Kara and Lee (who she is able to fight evenly partly because Helo beat up on him in an earlier fight and partly because Kara resorts to dirty fighting) collapse into each other's arms, their faces bloody messes, she tells him, \"I missed you.\" His mouth filled with blood, he is barely able to say, \"I missed you too.\" Her face buried in his shoulder, you can see her smile broadly as the episode ends. One of the best episodes in the show's run.7. In a stunning scene on a Cylon basestar, D'Anna Biers tortures Baltar while he manages to project to a beach where Six makes love to him to get him through the ordeal. As he tells Six \"I love you\" D'Anna hears the words as addressed to her and although torturing him feels deeply moved. It is a sequence that has to be seen to be believed.8. Adama and Laura's intimacy. Through Season Three Adama and Laura grow closer and closer, as intimate as two people can be while remaining completely Platonic. They still have conflicts. When Laura tries to justify stealing Hera and faking her death Adama walks away without even listening to her. And in the finale Roslin feels betrayed by his vote of Not Guilty in Baltar's trial. But you get the sense that they have moved to a new level. That they have an intimacy that can't be affected by mere disagreement. The highpoint of their intimacy might be their smoking dope on New Caprica and cuddling while gazing up at the stars. It is so wonderful to see two people who have shouldered so much in order to save the remnants of humanity to get a few minutes of peace/9. Lee Adama's moment on the stand. During Baltar's trial Romo Lampkin (magnificently portrayed by Mark Shepard) calls Lee onto the witness stand even though he is serving as co-counsel. Jamie Bamber's performance is one of the season highlights and perhaps the best moment in a season finale stuffed to overflowing with truly great moments.10. The last ten minutes of the season: In the final few minutes of the season we learn the identify of four of the Final Five: Tigh, Tyrol, Samuel T. Anders, and Tory (the four T's--giving additional credence to the thought of some that Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace is the fifth member) by their response to a song that they keep hearing in their heads, which turns out, almost impossibly, to be Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" (leading some to refer to them as the Dylons). Then the Cylons attack. The four new Cylons ponder what to do before Tigh magnificently tells the other three: \"The ship is under attack, we do our jobs. . . . My name is Saul Tigh. I am an officer in the Colonial Fleet. Whatever else I am, whatever else it means, that's the man I want to be. And if I die today, that's the man I'll be. But those lines are rivaled by the last of the season, as Lee pursues \"a bogie at my ten\" in his Viper and discovers none other than Kara Thrace, who had died spectacularly three episodes earlier. She looks at Lee, assures him that it really is her (a fact confirmed by executive producer Ron Moore, who also confirmed that the four Cylons really are Cylons), and tells him, \"It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is. And I'm gonna take us there.\" The camera pulls up over their two Vipers and then rapidly pulls back through the colonial fleet, through the pursing Cylons, back through the nebula and an arm of the Milky Way, and then rushes across the galaxy to our solar system, focusing on earth as the season ends. It is an utterly breathtaking moment.This is absolutely essential television. If you care for great television, this is the kind of stuff you have to care about. The tragedy is that while every major television critics has passionately praised the show and while a host of major publications from TV Guide to Time to Rolling Stone have proclaimed it the best show on TV, it has struggled to find viewers. The irony is that many Sci-fi fans don't watch it because it doesn't resort to the clich&eacute;s that dominate the genre and make it in most cases completely unchallenging television and many mainstream TV fans don't watch it because they mistakenly think it will only appeal to Sci-fi fans. It is what it is: the best show on TV. You need to watch this.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Another stunning season for the best show on television", "unixReviewTime": 1201132800, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2008"},

I preferred to watch Star Trek. However, I am hooked on this remake. The acting is great and the plot captivating. The characters are believable, and the cinematography quite spectacular. There are many twists in the story: you will be eagerly awaiting the next episode. My favorite character: Kate `Starbuck'!Though I did not like Battlestar Galactica Razor, and actually started Season 3 with low expectations because of it, I ended up loving Season 3.Season 2 ended with the Cylons discovering and invading New Caprica. Gaius Baltar, the President of the twelve colonies, surrenders to them, while Galactica and the rest of the fleet escape.Season 3 opens with the stranded Colonials struggling to survive under the Cylon rule. A terrorist group is formed to fight the Cylons, and sacrifices are made. We see humans strapping themselves with bombs, and blowing themselves up in the presence of Cylons and their human sympathizers.Can we stop for a second here? Isn't this what the Palestinians are doing in Israel, and the Iraqis in Iraq? What are the producers of this show trying to tell us? Is it that whenever a nation takes over another all means at one's disposal should be used to attack the invader, including using humans as bombs? Furthermore, terrorism is shown to be in the eye of the beholder. To the colonials, the terrorists are freedom fighters. To the Cylons, they are simply terrorists. There are some provocative scenes, but after all, this is the kind of world we live in.We are shown Admiral Adama struggling with his crew to save the colonials, and to resume his quest to find Earth. The following is a spoiler so stop reading now if you haven't watched the show yet: Adama does come back to New Caprica and rescues the Colonials. The Season continues with trying to find Earth. New clues are discovered, and a planet is found where early Earth settlers lived.Season 3 focuses on the human element, survival, and punishment. Even after the Colonials are rescued by Adama, some crew members take the role of vigilante, ejecting betrayers into space out of an airlock. These `victims' are not judged by a jury of their peers, nor are they given legal representation.  Again we are shown how people broken by war resort to unconventional and immoral actions that are fully justifiable by them alone. Again, depends through which eyes you are looking. Adama did not see such actions justifiable, and he put a stop to them. However, the perpetrators, or self-appointed jury, were never charged.I very much liked the episode where a chance is given to Adama to exterminate the Cylons. There is talk of genocide, and many in the fleet are against exterminating the Cylons. But wait a second. Cylons are machines. If today we decided to destroy all Windows based PCs in the world in favor for Apple, would this be genocide? What if some of the Windows PC contained human DNA, would destroying them then qualify as genocide? Meanwhile, though, the Cylons decide against exterminating the human race, resorting to living in harmony with them. Again, the writers manage to include provocative topics in this series. Isn't this what good TV is all about?Another episode I liked was the trial of Gaius Baltar, bringing to mind scenes from John Grisham. Again, whether Baltar is a traitor or not depends on the eye of the beholder. We know he was forced to take certain actions by the Cylons, but we also know that he had his own motivations in certain actions as well. His trial brings up many provocative and controversial topics. I personally thought that episode was the best one. I like it when TV episodes make me think days on end.The Season ends with a huge revelation: some of the Galactica crew are actually Cylons. I won't tell you who, because I know some of you who haven't seen the show will read this review, and this revelation could spoil the whole season! Just let's say you will be utterly surprised. However, I think the writers took a big risk with such a revelation. We'll have to wait for Season 4 to see what all of this means. Will the Cylons and human beings end up living in harmony?Starbuck is also resurrected in the last episode. We saw her die three episodes earlier. She says to Lee,\"It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is, and I'm going to take us there.\" Is she a Cylon too? Did Lee see another Starbuck copy?I really enjoyed the bonus disk, \"The Story so far.\" This episode recaps all that happened from the beginning of Season 1 to this Season. There were many scenes I had forgotten, and this episode sort of brought everything together again.There is only one issue I have with this show: I think there are too many standalone episodes that don't really seem to advance the main plot of the show. The major appeal of this show (at least to me) is its continuity: how each episode continues on the previous one. Seeing too many standalone episodes kind of destroys the flow of the storyline, and slows down the action.Battlestar Galactica is a great show for all sci-fi fans!

There's Lee Adama and wife Dee, whom he married mainly to try to get over Kara Thrace.  Kara herself is revealed to be the daughter of a bitter, abusive mother.  Lee's complicated relationship with his father, William, is further strained to the breaking point during Baltar's trial.  In the meantime, Saul Tigh continues to drink himself into a stupor over having killed his beloved but traitorous wife, Ellen, and then discovers a horrifying truth about himself along with several colleagues.  The heretofore likeable Felix Gaeta turns out to have been in league with Baltar, to a degree, and then perjures himself on the witness stand.

If you disagree post a review as these reviews are designed to help fans who haven't purchased or seen the show make a decision NOT whether you agree or disagree (that's what the comments section is about). Moving on...Every season of every TV show has episodes that don't stand up to the best that has come before and after.The show looks very good. The extras include podcasts, deleted scenes a terrific extended episode of one of Ronald Moore's favorite episodes \"Unfinished Business\". There are also 2 episode commentary tracks in addition to the podcasts ported over from the web from the original broadcast. David Eick's video blogs are also included as well as the webisodes (which I never got around to watching so it is kind of cool having it here). I would appreciate more behind-the-scenes type of specials but I like that sort of stuff. Fans who just want the episodes will be pretty well served by its presentation here.This is another really good set. I am disappointed that we don't have a Blu-ray version (yet) and I find it unlikely that Universal will be releasing this on HD-DVD with the collapse of the HD-DVD consortium. The show looks better than the standard definition broadcasts but not quite as sharp as the high definition. I'm looking forward to the fourth and final season of this terrific show. I'm also looking forward to Moore's future series (I am a bit disappointed with \"BG\" producer David Eick's update of \"The Bionic Woman\" which, while it has its moments can't even compare to \"BG\").PLOT SUMMARY AND SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW:  The third season has to my mind some of the best episodes of the series particularly during the episodes on New Caprica leading up to the deliverance from the Cylons. When we last saw the survivors of humanity they had settled on New Caprica. They were abandoned by the Galatica and Pegasus when multiple Cylon warships showed up in orbit because Adama (Edward James Olmos)and Lee (Jamie Bamber)felt that they weren't prepared to take them on. We get a healthy glimpse into the rigors and harshness of the Cylon occupation showing that, interestingly, they aren't any better or less flawed than their human captors.Saul(Michael Hogan)has started a resistence movement carrying out guerilla warfare against the Cylons to try and cause as much damage as possible in hopes of helping Adama on the ground when the Galatica returns to save them.From there the series deals with the fall out of settling on New Caprica in the first place, how humanity will deal with collaborators (it's one of the most riveting episodes of the season in my opinion), find out that the Galatica and the Cylons are on the right course for Earth and that there is a mysterious plague striking the Cylons. As with previous episodes the show deals with a number of ethical issues that other shows wouldn't (and couldn't) touch. I know that there are those that were disappointed with the 3rd season feeling it ran too long or that many of the stand alone episodes were weak but I would disagre; I felt that the quality was consistent with the first two seasons dealing with interesting and complex themes.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "3rd season highlights are as good as previous episodes while some of the stand alone episodes don't quite hold up as well", "unixReviewTime": 1206057600, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2008"},

After a somewhat lackluster Season 2.5, BSG got back on track with an action-packed Season 3.  The colonialists have settled on New Caprica, only to be invaded again by the Cylons, although the Cylons have a different intention this time.  The season is full of action and intriguing plotlines, as the colonialists mount a resistance movement to escape from New Caprica, which reverberates throughout the entire season.Season 3 contains some extremely strong plotlines and episodes.  I was particularly impressed with \"Collaborators\" in which the resistance deals with the colonialists who worked with the Cylons in various ways.  The episode is powerful and reflects the kind of long-term implications of war; creator Ronald Moore aptly compared this episode to the kinds of things seen in France after WWII, for example.  I'm always a sucker for the darker, more politically-tinged episodes of BSG, and this one really did it for me.The season contains several stand-alone episodes that don't continue the main plotline of the search for Earth.  Some of these episodes work well, especially \"Dirty Hands,\" which considers the blue-collar workers who are toiling in the fleet under nearly impossible conditions.  Unfortunately, some of the stand-alones are less successful, particularly \"Hero\" and \"A Day in the Life.\"  Overall, I was pleased with the directions in which they take the main characters, although I was disappointed that Duwalla's part continues to shrink and be less satisfying.  I also was not fond of the turn taken by Starbuck as she follows her \"destiny.\"  I've never been a Starbuck fan, and I found this entire plotline irritating.  Hearing Ronald Moore give Katee Sackhoff constant tongue-baths on the dvd podcast commentaries just added to my irritation.  The woman does all her acting by curling her lips, clearing her throat, and making weird snorting giggles.  Please make her stop!  Ok, I feel better now.Fortunately, the season ends with some very exciting episodes.  Foremost among them is the reveal of four of the final five Cylons.  As is typical of BSG, the season ends with some great cliffhangers that promise to take the series in intriguing new directions.  What I perhaps love most about BSG is its willingness to make changes rather than resting on its laurels.  The story is constantly driving forward and taking us to new places, which is sometimes uncomfortable but always thrilling.  For me, Season Three was better than Season 2.5 and about in par with Seasons 2.0 and 1.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cylons and Hybrids and Starbuck.

It had its epic moments, of course, but I always felt as the drama was held back just when it should have been accelerated.  In this third season, however, the drama, character development, and overall plotlines are some of the most extraordinary hours ever produced for television.Because I am loathe to give out any spoilers, I won't discuss the contents of the episodes in this review.  Suffice it to say, however, that viewers get a \"little bit of everything\" in this third go-'round, including...-An insider's point of view on the Cylons.-Some incredible emotional drama stemming from the New Caprica situation.-Not a single episode that is a \"dud\"-A finale that is so epic and surprising that it takes a while to fully even sink in.I started watching BSG because I was looking for another \"LOST\" (what I consider to be the greatest TV show of all-time).  Though I don't think (as a whole) BSG lives up to that lofty mantra, I will say that it's third season is as compelling of drama as anything LOST ever produced.Thus, I do not understand the many people who consider this to be the \"weakest\" season of the show, as for me it was the season where everything finally came together in the big-time payoff.

He doesn't quite remember what happened at the beach-house at the end of the previous season of FX's Rescue Me, but all he does know is that he is under investigation, while Sheila (Callie Thorne) picks up the pieces.  To make things more hectic, Tommy and his estranged wife Janet (Andrea Roth) are taking care of the new baby, that may be Tommy's or may be his late brother's (Dean Winters).  Tommy's concerns over the baby's safety come into question as well, which leads to a decision that could forever destroy any repairs made to his marriage with Janet.  In the meantime, Chief Reilly (Jack McGee) gets worse news; Sean (Steven Pasquale) starts to grow a pair in regards to his new marriage to Maggie (Tatum O'Neal) and learns a big secret about Probie Mike (Michael Lombardi) in one of the series' funniest and shocking moments; Kenny's (John Scurti) relationship with an ex-nun takes a downward turn; Franco (Daniel Sunjata) has a big decision to make while trying to get back his daughter from Alicia (Susan Sarandon); Tommy's daughter Colleen (Natalie Distler) starts to rebel in a big way; and a new recruit (Larenz Tate) makes an impact on the group.  While the drama and character development was high in the fourth season of Rescue Me, there was just something about this season that didn't feel all that compelling compared to what has been done on the series before.  Also, there was a bit of an uneven feel with a number of already established characters (particularly Probie Mike), but despite the flaws, the fourth season of Rescue Me is still a more than solid season of the series.  The season concludes on a bit of a down note, but seeds have been planted for some big time developments to come.

The characters are rich and deep, their motivations mutli-faceted, their loyalties complex, ever-changing, or just non-existent.  Glenn Close is brilliant as Patty Hewes, portraying nuanced emotions with a deftness rarely seen on television.Season 1 focuses on a lawsuit against a &#34;pump and dump&#34; business owner named Arthur Frobisher (played surprisingly well by Ted Danson) who convinced his employees to empty their pensions and retirement plans into the company's stock before selling every last share he owned.  Acquitted in a criminal hearing, it's up to Patty Hewes and her firm (including the incomparable Rose Byrne as new associate Ellen Parsons) to make things right with the employees who've been left with nothing.It sounds very court-centric on the surface, but it isn't.  There's mystery, double-crosses, schemes, DIRTY LAWYERING!, and even murder.  The story is told creatively.  We see flashes of the present, but the majority of the narrative takes place in the past.  We see the case unfold and the events that led up to the harrowing opening scene.  As the present plays out slowly over the season, the past eventually catches up. When the two meet, it's sheer brilliance.

It has more to do with the legal process (deposition, finding witnesses, filing motions, etc.).I've been watching this on Netflix instant and was hooked from the first episode. It starts out as a CSI \"Who Dunnit\" approach, showing someone who was murdered followed by a random woman roaming the streets covered in blood. Each episode reveals a piece of the puzzle, until everything makes sense with the final episode and brings you up to speed. By the time you catch up, the season is over and you're amazed they were able to draw you in for so many episodes. And, you want more!The cast is amazing with some heavy hitters. Ted Danson stars as Mr. Frobisher, a multimillionaire businessman who will stop at nothing to keep his money safe. Glenn Close plays Pattie Hughes, a rough and tumble lawyer who has many, many sides to her. Trying to figure her out is darn near impossible. She adapts to anything thrown at her and seems to be one step ahead at almost all times. The second season features Mario Peebles, Timothy Olyphant, William Hurt, and Marcia Gray Harden.

Harris \"Film aficionado\"", "helpful": [159, 165], "reviewText": "One of the biggest treats of the 2007 television season was \"Damages,\" a wicked and wonderful legal thriller from FX.  Headlined by Glenn Close, I expected to enjoy this show--but I wasn't prepared for the level of sophistication, complexity, and intelligence it offered up from its first twisty, and twisted, moments.  Made for adults, this drama demands attention and may not be for the casual viewer.  With its intricate plotting and structure, the story is told from different time periods interwoven throughout each episode.  Essentially, snippets of the story are presented in each time frame, so the audience is left to speculate about the full truth in any given instance.  However, as the season progresses, the pieces start to connect in unexpected ways that can both surprise and frustrate.  I'd compare the narrative flow of \"Damages\" to that of a fine novel--telling you just enough so that you are tantalized to stick around for the next chapter.The plot of \"Damages\" is a knotty web that is difficult to describe briefly.  Ostensibly, the show revolves around a naive young lawyer played by Rose Byrne.  The opening scenes show a bedraggled and bloodied Byrne stumbling down the streets of New York--apparently the victim (or perhaps the perpetrator) of an act of violence.  Cut to six months earlier and a proper introduction is made.  Byrne is seduced and recruited by a major law firm run by Glenn Close.  Close seems to have a hidden agenda, but Byrne is quickly overcome by the trappings of success and acceptance.  The firm is handling an enormous class action lawsuit against one of the town's most prominent businessmen, played by Ted Danson, and Byrne ends up squarely in the midst of much legal intrigue.  What follows includes lying, blackmail, corruption, and even murder--no one in this story remains an innocent.While I actually think the plot is the real star of \"Damages\" (I don't think I've ever said that about a TV show before)--it certainly doesn't hurt that the cast is uniformly excellent.  Don't be surprised if you see Close front and center come awards time.  Her thinly veiled menace and cutting remarks make for classic villainy, but Close pulls it off in a way that you can't help but love!  Byrne and all the key supporting players are solid and believable.  I particularly liked Zeljko Ivanek and Peter Facinelli, but the real revelation to me was Ted Danson.  Honestly, I've followed Danson since he was a bit player in \"Body Heat\" and I think this is by far his best role.  Mixing equal parts charm and bile, this is a great actor in a beautifully written role.Again, I don't recommend \"Damages\" to everyone--I only wish I could!  If, however, you love sophisticated drama--give this a shot.  The DVD format is the perfect way to watch this show at your own pace and enjoy all its subtleties, surprises, and delights.  But, be reminded, if you sit down to watch this show--WATCH IT!  Otherwise, you might not appreciate how intricately put together \"Damages\" really is.

But rather than lawyers, all the characters are basically gangsters on both sides of the case. Glenn Close gives an extraordinary performance and Rose Byrne does better than expected, but the story and script really let them down.At the heart of the story is basically a lifted-from-Enron case where the employees of a bankrupt company are going after its former CEO. But its a superficial resemblence because whoever wrote the script understood little about such matters.Ted Danson drags the whole piece down. Since Glenn Close is playing an evil character, Danson's character has to be played as arch-evil. Mustache twirling evil. And Danson delivers an astonishly stupid broadly drawn evil character. And he is probably close to what Danson imagines every non-Hollywood CEO to being. Danson goes out of his way to make sure that there is no possible way to have any sympathy for rich Mr. businessman. And thats really the only way for the story to work given that Glenn Close is playing a gangster.For a series about the law, there is very little \"law\" in it and what law it has is done unimaginatively. They never get beyond the depositions. They never follow anything like the timeline of a real case. And why not. To the main characters, law is a distraction. If lawyers spent time on legal matters, when would they have time all the gangster stuff: Hiding and killing witnesses, blackmailing the opposing lawyer, spying, stealing, witness intimidation, bribing prosecutors, containing the ambitions of the underbosses and so on. The character Glenn Close somewhat resembles is the lawyer Sean Penn played in the film \"Carlito's way\".One of the core problems with the Glenn Close character is that her word means nothing. Every deal she makes, she goes back on. A stand alone character can work like that. But not someone running a law firm. Any organization runs on a certain level of trust. A lawyer operating within the profession depends on a certain level of trust. If she was going to act like that, she needed in the context of the show to keep herself innocent and to preserve her image at all costs.The series would have been more interesting if it had been more realistic and if both sides in the case had been shades of grey. And to cover all the stages of a case: (1) Selling the client to take you on as a lawyer (2) figuring out a strategy(3) depositions and discovery, (4) negotiating over a settlement (5) Witness prep (5) jury selection (6) the trial.The combination of amoral gangster lawyer and ruthless crusader for justice also really doesn't work. Every time Glenn Close starts to talks about \"victims\", it comes across as totally false.By the end of the season, they have started walking down the sad road toward making excuses for Glenn Close's behavior. Dead baby drama in a cemetary is an incredibly cheap way to drum up sympathy.This is another of those things where the potential and most of the actors end up being greater than the script that they were given.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "uneven gangster drama", "unixReviewTime": 1326672000, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2012"},

It also gives us the chance to watch TV shows that are serial like and that we abandoned when we missed that all important episode. Such is the case with DAMAGES.This FX series follows a young beginning attorney named Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne) who has just been hired by the most notable attorney around, Patty Hewes (Glenn Close). Patty is a no nonsense player who lives to win and will do nearly anything to make that happen. When Patty takes a case, more than likely her client will be the winner.At the moment, Hewes & Associates are involved in their biggest case yet, a class action suit against an unscrupulous CEO named Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson) who sold out his stocks and left the employees of the company with nothing. While the government was unable to prove any wrongdoing, Patty and company are dead set on recouping the losses these people incurred for them.But all is not fair in love and war and this case is nothing less than a war between giants. While Patty uses everything at her disposal to try and bring Frobisher to justice, he and his lawyer do everything they can to block her or to make sure that no one talks, even possibly resorting to murder.But that's the thing about this show. As it progresses the fine line between who is wearing the white hat and who is wearing the black becomes clouded. Attacks on witnesses, payoffs, dog killings all seem like the work of the defendant. But then again, could they be the tactics of the plaintiff trying to make someone uncomfortable enough to make a wrong move? Add to that the fact that young Ellen has connections to the case that may have resulted in her being employed to begin with and we end up with a subplot that ties into the main.The twists and turns of the legal world, in and out of the courtroom (more often out) make for dynamic viewing that holds you in its grip from the opening scenes of Ellen leaving an apartment covered in blood until the last episode. The acting is better than can be expected on most TV shows and the direction shows a storytelling technique that moves the plot along while holding your interest from week to week or in this case from disc to disc.Keep in mind while this is a solid piece of drama for viewers, it is not a piece that is recommended for children as it is filled with adult content.

This is the opposite case. Call it theTrue Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)effect. Every episode is exciting and drives the show forward. Every episode has something cool that keeps you watching to the next one. And the title sequence? VERY cool.Yet when it's over, you'll feel like you've just wasted 13 hours. It's not so much that the whole thing falls apart at the end due to the stupid denouement of the major mystery (although the answer as to why Rose Byrne comes into a police station all bloody with a dead boyfriend in her bathtub is very stupid) but also because once it's over all of the missteps in the piece become glaringly obvious. When you are watching it, you just enjoy Glen Close and Ted Danson at their crazy manipulative best. Glen Close is in pure bunny-boiling evil form (and she does kill the dog) and Ted Danson is like a version of Sam gone to pot without conscience. The games that these two (and Danson's lawyer) play to one up each other are particularly amusing and convoluted.Sadly, once it's over the plot holes become way too obvious. A simple malfeasance case is probably too dull to sustain an entire show, but in one episode, Glen Close manipulates one of her own witnesses to lie in deposition in order to ruin her case and make the Danson camp think that they are winning. In another episode Close kills a dog which I believe might be problematic even for lawyers. And Ted Danson openly talking to one of the people suing him in order to manipulate the lawsuit is just dumb all around. And if we enjoy watching Glen Close be evil, why do the writers think that we need to see her crying like at the end ofDangerous LiaisonsBut really, the entire thing falls on Rose Byrne's tiny shoulders and Rose Byrne is just not up to the task. Yes, she's supposed to be a naive lawyer just out of law school but most of the time she comes off as utterly stupid. When her assistant ruins all of her appointments and messes up her day, she has to wait the entire episode to fire him. And it's supposed to be some kind of fall from grace when she's no longer a nice person. Partially it's the problem of the scripts. She is supposed to be naive, but most of the time the scripts make her act like an utter idiot. But mostly, it's Rose Byrne's fault. When Glen Close is telling her that she admires her because she is very shrewd, well there's nothing all that shrewd about her. Even though, it's obvious that she's been hired in order to get to a witness, there's nothing about her acting that suggests that she's anything other than a vacant and pretty face to be manipulated. This is Mary Sue characterization at it's worse. She has nothing to offer, yet everyone claims that she offers the world. And if this is a woman who comes from hardscrabble circumstances who clawed her way to the top of her law school class and can turn down a 130K starting salary, we SHOULD believe that she's actually intelligent and shrewd and just as much of a force of nature as Glen Close. She SHOULD be Glen Close's chaacter in process.Instead she's just dumb. Sure, it's fun watching Glen Close push her around and play with her like a tiger playing with a bunny rabbit; but if the script is telling us that she's this amazing lawyer learning how to be a manipulative powerhouse, then that potential should be obvious. Yet it's not. And that's why overall, this thing fails.I'd recommend buying it if you watched a few episodes and liked it, but be prepared to be disappointed.

From there the series takes a trip back in time six months earlier a case that Ellen worked on as a new attorney at Patricia Hewes (Glenn Close) & Associates. It's a civil case where Hewes is suing multi-billionaire Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson) for hollowing out his company and robbing 5000 employees of his company of their pension plans in the process. Having escaped the prosecution of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Frosbisher now must defend himself from claims that he benefited by selling his stocks before his company collapsing and getting away scot-free. Frobisher of course insists that he is innocent and was as much a victim losing the company he cared for as the employees. We see the entire case unfold before our eyes, the double dealings, double crosses and underhanded attempts by both the Hewes and Frobisher's attorney to gain the upper hand in this litigation.\"Damages\" is compelling, fascinating and well written featuring a wide variety of characters with their own agendas. No one truly is an angel here although the nave Ellen comes mighty close as she finds herself dragged into Hewes' world and manipulated as much by her boss as she is by the opposition in the case. A personal connection between Ellen and the case is uncovered which also makes Ellen suspect that the only reason she got the job was so that she could be used to gain the upper hand in the case. In the process Ellen sees her ambitions and dreams pull further and further away from her reach just as she thinks she is climbing the corporate ladder of success.  Hewes tells Ellen at one point, \"trust no one\" and the same could be applied to everyone involved in the case.Academy Award nominee/Emmy winner Close, Emmy Award winner Danson, Bryne, Tate Donovan, Peter Riegert, Michael Nouri and a host of film/TV/Broadway veterans bring these characters to life with a vibrancy rare in series television. If the story sounds like it was ripped from the headlines, the Enron, Worldcom and other scandals where corporate CEO's betrayed the public trust and manipulated the market inspired the series but it's the compelling characters and drama that will make you stick around to the conclusion of this 13 episode FX series.The opening had me scratching my head in puzzlement--it looked like crappy low-rez video. It's a faade like everything else here as it is simply a sequence showing us the raw reality that Ellen finds himself trapped in. As the show jumps back six months in time to the beginning of the case, we get a beautifully rendered high definition video image. There are a couple of problems with video noise that occur. It isn't a perfect presentation on Blu-ray but it looks extremely good.Audio sounds marvelous with a TrueHD 5.1 mix that uses the format quite well. It isn't compressed and has terrific dynamic range. The 5.1 format is nicely used given that this is primarily a dialogue driven show with nice ambient effects captured in the surround channels.I was surprised that we only get two audio commentaries on this set as I had hoped for more but both are effective and insightful. Glenn Close, writers/producers Todd Kessler & Glenn Kessler, Daniel Zelman and director Allen Coulter appear on the pilot episode discussing issues they ran into shooting on location in New York during a nasty winter, issues they ran into with trying to bring the series in on budget but without messing with the quality of the show. Close is a bit quiet during the commentary it would be fun to hear her let loose on one by herself or with a moderator. I would have loved to hear Close and her co-stars on a separate audio commentary track discuss the craft of acting, their approach to the material and some of their thoughts during their performances but what we do get is quite good.The second audio commentary features actor Zeljko Ivanek front and center dominating the discussion with the Kesslers and Zelman joining in with technical tidbits from time-to-time. Ivanek has long been one of my favorite character actors and he has largely been underused in many TV shows and movies so its nice to see him get a character as juicy as defense attorney Ray Fiske to sink his teeth into southern drawl and all.\"Willful Acts\" is a half hour behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the series. \"Understanding Class Action\" is designed with an interfact that gives viewers a background on how class action lawsuits work and a definition of the various phrases thrown around in the series. \"Trust No One\" clocks in under fifteen minutes and focuses more on the characters in the series. We also get a variety of deleted scenes. The really cool feature of this set is that the disc is enabled so that the player can remember which episodes you've watched and jump right back to the one you had next in rotation if you choose the \"play all\" feature.\"Damages\" is a terrific, compelling legal drama. All 13 episodes of the series plus the extras are on three Blu-ray discs and you also get an insert that gives you the title of each episode, a brief synopsis and credits for each one as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Machiavellian characters dominate legal drama \"Damages\" featuring terrific performances and a top notch Blu-ray transfer", "unixReviewTime": 1201392000, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2008"},

Reynard \"kairosdreaming\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Maybe these are all starting to run together for me, or maybe it's just that I was lukewarm to this particular season, but I just didn't find it as watchable as the majority of the other seasons.  It is the eighth year, and that's a high mark when it comes to ideas and plot-lines.Law and Order SVU is about the special cases.  Those cases of rape, child abuse, and elder abuse that typically deal with hard to face victims and emotional tragedy.  They're hard to watch, but because of a generally stellar cast it has become one of the most popular series out there. While you don't have to watch the season in order, it is good to at least try because there's a bit of background on the detectives that you could miss out on otherwise.  But the episodes are primarily stand-alone, with each resolving by the end of the episode.There were a few stand out episodes in this season.  \"Confrontation\" takes a horrible fear of rape, and multiplies it by having the rapist come back again and again for insidious purposes.  \"Scheherazade\" has a killer telling a tale, but drawing it out to elude his own death.  But with these episodes come a bunch that after watching the first time, I just skip over them when I rewatch the season.  And those are the episodes near the end that involve Benson's half brother plot.  I know they were trying to twist things around but it just didn't grip me and I thought her tale better when she didn't family ties.  At least the last episode had some pretty big cliffhangers, making you wonder what was going to happen and eager for the next season.Characters:Christopher Meloni as Det. Elliot StablerMariska Hargitay as Det. Olivia BensonRichard Belzer as Det. John MunchIce-T as Det. Fin TutuolaDiane Neal as ADA Casey NovakB. D. Wong as Dr. George HuangTamara Tunie as Dr. Melinda WarnerDann Florek as Capt. Don CragenConnie Nielsen as Det. Dani BeckAdam Beach as Det. Chester LakeThe original cast of characters are all here, but there are a few more that had a considerable amount of time in this season.  Nielsen as Detective Dani Beck replaces Hargitay in the first half of the season.  While she was ok, she wasn't as good as Hargitay, and it was a relief to see her come back.  Meloni too just didn't have the chemistry with Nielsen like he does with Hargitay and so his performances weren't as moving as they normally are.  Belzer and Ice-T continue to play a secondary role and had an average amount of screentime when compared to the other seasons.  I did like the few roles played by Beach as Detective Chester Lake.  He had a calming presence about him that I enjoyed.This series is not for the faint of heart and especially not this season.  There is violence, staged scenes of rape, abuse and other harsh topics that not all will want to see.  But the show is gritty and tries to be realistic so it could be hard for some people.  The majority of the camerawork is on the detectives but they do have to process the crimes so at least one time in every episode, there's something tragic to see.Not the best of the seasons but I'll certainly keep watching.  When it's been around this long there's a reason for it, and I know the series can certainly improve to its former glory again.Review by M.

From 1995 to 2007 he served hard time for murders he didn't commit. When DNA evidence surfaces proving his innocence, Crews is released and reinstated in the force (he also lands some serious settlement money). Now Detective Crews finds himself working with a new partner even as he covertly seeks answers to what the hell happened.LIFE looks to be a very promising cop detective show, and not because the mysteries themselves are dynamite stuff or anything. No, the viewing addiction lies in watching the lead actor work his craft. Britisher Damian Lewis is simply fabulous as the wounded, brooding protagonist, trying to piece his life back together. It's fun watching Crews apply his askewed perspective on his cases. I'm normally not a fan of folks who sling zen about, but Lewis makes it an integral part of his character. And if it's a loose cannon with an agenda slinging that zen, all the better. After all, zen helped Crews survive the penitentiary. I also like the little touches which remind us that Crews is still coping with his new found freedom, whether it's his habit of munching on fresh fruit (they never have fresh fruit in prison) or his preference for light and open air or the fact that he still doesn't have furniture in his home.Lewis's supporting cast is so-so. I do enjoy Sarah Shahi, who's a former Dallas Cowboy cheerleader. She plays the no-nonsense Dani Reese, Crews' new partner and not ecstatic about it. It's true that her character tends to fall in the generic character-saddled-with-demons category, so, yeah, nothing new from that angle. But I think she has very good chemistry with Damian Lewis, and I just love her bemused or irritated reactions to Crews' barrage of philosophical quirk. Two other actors who nicely play off Lewis are sexy Brooke Langton as Crews' smitten attorney and Adam Arkin as Crews' former inmate and current best friend and financial adviser.I like the show's use of interview clips. They reveal certain insights and usher several sub-plots into the light. We learn, for instance, that Crews' former partner didn't stand up for him and that Crews' beautiful wife had divorced him while he was serving out his time. We even get a teeny whiff of the conspiracy surrounding Crews' frame-up. More layers and foreshadowings, thanks to these clips.SPOILERS now.With the steady influx of crime drama on TV, I wasn't planning on tuning in to this show. Then the pilot changed my mind. Other standouts? \"Powerless\" is the powerful sixth episode, focusing on Dani as she pursues a rapist who'd been haunting her AA meetings. \"Farthingale\" (episode 8) is a fun one, an intriguing mystery which begins with a man having been half blown off by an exploding stove. Then there's the intense two-part story arc (episodes 10 & 11: \"Dig A Hole\" & \"Fill It Up\") as Crews finally tracks down the man who committed the murders for which he was incarcerated. In \"Dig A Hole\" we also get to see a showdown of sorts between Crews' new and former partners.SPOILERS end.I can't stress enough how good Damian Lewis is on this show. I remember him from HBO's great wartime mini-series,Band of Brothers, and he made an impact back then, too, and was even nominated for a Golden Globe (although he didn't win). Damian Lewis, with his complex performance here, elevates LIFE from a humdrum procedural into a riveting police drama.

Whitehead \"Werthead\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Chuck Bartowski works for a huge electronics store in Los Angeles, Buy More, but is still annoyed at being framed for a misdemeanour he didn't commit which led to him getting thrown out of Stanford University several years earlier. Bryce Larkin, Chuck's former best friend and the guy who framed him, sends Chuck a mysterious email which causes him to pass out. When he wakes up, he discovers that he has downloaded the Intersect - the entire American secret database on international criminals, terrorists and other restricted subjects - into his brain. With the Intersect itself destroyed and Larkin dead, this means that the CIA and NSA need Chuck to help them defend American interests. Thus, he is forced into a double life of maintaining his working life at the Buy More whilst also helping CIA agent Sarah Walker and NSA agent John Casey fight international crime using his subliminal knowledge.Right from the start, Chuck puts its colours on the mast: this is going to be a show where the idea is to watch it and enjoy yourself, with even the vaguest hint of realism thrown out of the door. In an age where American network shows are being ignored in favour of 'edgy' cable series, it's a relief to find a show that is just so much damn fun.Chuck works on a number of levels. The casting is excellent, with Zachary Levi making for an appealing protagonist, balancing geekiness with likability and a growing ability to cope with the crazy situations he's been thrown into. The ridiculously attractive Yvonne Strahovski makes for a great straight-woman as Sarah, who pulls off the 'coldly professional CIA agent' character well but then develops the role to become more conflicted in her loyalties as the season progresses. The mighty Adam Baldwin - Jayne from Firefly - is also great as Casey, whose first instinct in any situation is extreme violence. The supporting cast, notably Chuck's family and his fellow workers at the Buy More, are also well-cast and entertaining.The show also has a great deal of geek-cred. One episode hinges on Chuck and his best friend Morgan (Joshua Gomez) being able to carry off their Halloween trick of dressing up as a sandworm from the Dune books, whilst in another Chuck reminisces on bonding with an ex-girlfriend over playing EverQuest. Another episode uses (classic 1980s text adventure) Zork references as a plot point. References range from the pretty obvious to the fairly obscure, and catching them is fun in itself.The series follows the now-traditional structure of having a season-spanning arc mixed up with lots of stand-alone episodes. The arc is actually fairly slight (there are hints that the NSA are building the Intersect 2.0 and indicating that once it is ready, Chuck will be expendable) but there are some ongoing character arcs and developments from episode to episode that work quite well. One character point - that Morgan has a huge crush on Chuck's sister - is actually a bit stalker-ish in the first couple of episodes due to the writers overegging it, but they sensibly pull it back and then dispose of it after giving Morgan another girlfriend later on, resolving the issue before it becomes too much of a problem.The individual episode storylines are mostly enjoyable, particularly the season finale in which the entire Buy More is cleared out after listening devices are discovered and the characters have to discover the fate of the store manager's stuffed fish. Something that is slightly problematic is that the somewhat mundane storylines at the Buy More or involving Chuck's family are often more enjoyable than the spy stuff, which is often formulaic (though always watchable). There are problems that ideas are reused a few too many times (particularly with Casey getting into trouble with a beautiful female agent which goes a bit wrong, which happens twice within a few episodes), but overall the series carries its stories off with aplomb. The show may actually have been helped by the first season being cut short by the 2007-08 Writer's Strike, allowing the producers to end the season early before too many more story points were revisited and prepare themselves for the second season.The first season of Chuck (****) is very entertaining, amusing and nicely geeky, with genuine wit and charm overcoming its more formulaic and cliched elements. The show balances humour and drama quite well, and the overall package is highly enjoyable. The season is available now on DVD in the UK and USA.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Relentlessly enjoyable", "unixReviewTime": 1309651200, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2011"},

It is a nicely balanced combination of action, spy spoof, and romantic comedy, featuring an outstanding cast and some sharp writing.  \"Chuck: The Complete First Season\" contains all thirteen episodes from a strike-shortened season, and some nice extra features.The premise: Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levi) is a twenty-something computer geek working for the BuyMore, a big-box electronics store in L.A.  He shares an apartment with his loving older sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) and her hunky doctor boyfriend.  His life has been stuck in neutral since being kicked out of Stanford, framed for cheating by a roommate who also stole his girlfriend.  One day, Chuck gets an email from his old roommate, which mysteriously implants a secret intelligence database known as the Intersect inside his head.Suddenly, Chuck must lead a double-life,  By day, he labors in the BuyMore with his offbeat co-workers, including his slacker best buddy Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez).  By night, and sometimes by day, he is a CIA asset.  He is \"handled\" by CIA agent Sarah Walker (attractive Australian actress Yvonne Strahovski) and hardnosed NSA assassin Major John Casey (Adam Baldwin).The Intersect causes Chuck to \"flash\" on various passing clues, prompting a weeky mission to foil some villian and his or her dastardly plot.  Invariably, the untrained and inept Chuck is told to \"wait in the car\" while Sarah and Casey pursue the bad guys.  Also invariably, Chuck ventures from the car and either needs rescuing or bumbles his way into rescuing his handlers.  Even though played tongue in cheek, the action sequences can get quite tense.At the heart of the series is the slowly evolving relationship between Chuck and Sarah, who as cover for her role as bodyguard, poses as his girlfriend.  For the totally smitten Chuck, this pseudo relationship is \"complicated.\"  The highly professional Sarah is not quite able to avoid developing feelings for the good hearted, decent and loyal Chuck.  Their efforts to pass off their relationship in front of Chuck's family and co-workers are the source of endless comedy and some genuinely touching moments.\"Chuck: The Complete First Season\" is very highly recommended as outstanding entertainment, just a little reminiscent of the old \"Get Smart\" series in an updated way.

CHUCK achieves that heady mix of humor, action, espionage, and even a dash of romance (or pining, to be more exact). And it'll have you rooting for the nerd hero Chuck Bartowski, the physically hapless but nonetheless invaluable new member of the U.S. secret agent fraternity. Whereas, before, Chuck was someone who for thrills lived life vicariously thru video games and films, he's all of a sudden forced to cope with experiencing the very intense real thing.Several SPOILERS follow.The 411 on the premise and plot: A rogue CIA agent, just before being killed, downloads a wealth of top secret government files into the brain of his old college roommate Chuck Bartowski, a seemingly disastrous choice at first blush. Chuck is a social misfit, a computer geek who toils at the Nerd Herd electronics department of the Buy More supermarket. His support system consists of his best bud Morgan, who's even more of a loser than Chuck, and Chuck's lovely, protective sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster), who is perpetually concerned for him and his lack of a social life. That Chuck lives with Ellie and her laid back boyfriend, Captain Awesome, doesn't exactly win him points with the cool set. But, for Chuck, things are about to change.Chuck meets Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), who seems to really like him. But Sarah is really a CIA agent sent to wrest the stolen intel from him. Finding out that the top secret data is imbedded in his noggin, she is then assigned to keep tabs on him. To do so, Sarah works at Wienerlicious and poses as Chuck's chica. Meanwhile, the NSA trots out its top operative, the no-nonsense John Casey (the awesome Adam Baldwin), who as cover hires on as a Buy More sales clerk.Nowadays, danger and intrigue lurk at every corner for Chuck Bartowski, who finds himself leading a double life and is now sometimes referred to as the Intersect (mostly by Casey). He speedily proves his value when the data in his brain enables him to put two and two together and uncover an assassination attempt. Soon, he's tangling with ninjas, shadowy agents, terrorists, and bombs - and that's just in the first episode. Further shows would unveil even greater peril and more mystery. Seeds of distrust are sown as Chuck also struggles with the constant hedging and fabrication brought on by his CIA and NSA minders. More importantly, despite obstacles put up by his nemesis, the evil Asian dude Harold Tang (okay, he's not really evil...but he's bald), Chuck's trying out for the assistant manager gig at the Buy More. Good luck, Chuck.End SPOILERS.CHUCK is a consistently funny, funny show doubling as a straight-up spy thriller. There are plenty of slick, potent action sequences, but the heart of the series is the comic fish-out-of-water premise of the geek caught in serious cloak-and-dagger environs. The show provides a steady dosage of nerd/slacker humor which always has me smiling for the duration of the episodes. And, instead of Chuck suddenly developing kung fu skills, the series makes sure that Chuck remains inept and a bit cowardly (Chuck would prefer to refer to it as being \"prudent\"). Zachary Levi as Chuck is wonderfully straight-faced yet has that comic timing down pat. He's very sympathetic as a guy whose big heart is shyly on his sleeve.Which leads us to another focal point of the show: Chuck's tentative relationship with the beautiful Sarah, who as a spy is forever on her guard and who's still grieving over her recent past with a fellow agent. But there's a connection between her and our favorite Nerd Herder, as Sarah realizes that Chuck really is a most decent dude. But only time will tell if it pans out. Australian Yvonne Strahovski is well cast as the lethal and accomplished secret agent, who can kick enemy agent heinie even a she dances sensuously with a clueless partner (yes, that would be Chuck). Yet Strahovski, when called for, can lend a torn, vulnerable air to her calculating superspy (check out \"Chuck versus the Nemesis\" to see just how conflicted she becomes). And, holy ministrone, she's hot! On the other hand, I don't think the looming Adam Baldwin is hot, but he's one of my favorite dudes to watch on TV. Fans of Joss Whedon will remember Baldwin from his memorable recurring roles in ANGEL and FIREFLY. Here, he makes for an intimidating sales clerk and government spy.I am currently in solid geek heaven with CHUCK. Here's hoping NBC continues to support this show for a busload of seasons. Here's to Chuck (and friends) waging war against irate Buy More patrons, staving off calculating co-workers, and also fending off some of the most diabolical enemies of America, mom, and apple pie. And all that while shouldering the stigma of a dead-end job. Way to go, Chuck!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Nerd Herder Who Loved Me", "unixReviewTime": 1206144000, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2008"},

His best friend is Morgan (Joshua Gomez), a fellow nerd who also works at Buy More.But things change drastically when Chuck gets an e-mail from former friend Bryce Larkin.

He's still hung-up over getting kicked out of university after his best friend Bryce Larkin framed him for cheating on an exam - and stole his girlfriend along the way.But then one day, completely out of the blue, Chuck gets an e-mail from Bryce. He opens it, and unwittingly has an entire database of government secrets downloaded into his head. Turns out that Bryce was a rogue spy for the CIA, and the last thing he managed to do before his death was send the stolen file to Chuck's computer.Now whenever he sees someone or something that's connected to international espionage, he has \"flashes\" that warn him of various criminals, terrorists and assassins in his midst (of which there seems to be a surprising amount in his neighbourhood). Enter Sarah Walker and John Casey. The former is a CIA agent that's been sent to find the missing data by feigning romantic interest in him, only to release that it's hidden within Chuck's brain. The latter is an intimidating NSA operative (and the man who shot Bryce) who is incredulous at the thought a man like Chuck could have a super-computer implanted in his brain.The two of them are relegated to monitoring Chuck (Casey as a BuyMore sales clerk, Sarah in the Wienerlicious across the road), occasionally drawing him into operations when they're in need of the specialized information stored inside his head. Just to add a little intrigue to the proceedings, Sarah poses as Chuck's girlfriend - given that she's stunning, all of Chuck's family and co-workers think he's hit the jackpot.Needless to say, you'll need to suspend your disbelief if you're going to enjoy \"Chuck\".

Spoilers!CHUCK VERSUS THE NEMESIS is the latest in a string of very nice episodes.  I've not been charmed by everything in this series.  There are fans of the show who love Morgan and those who utterly detest him.  I'm of the latter camp.  And early in the season I almost gave up on the show due to the series initial emphasis on standalone episodes couples with more Morgan than I could tolerate.  But there has been slightly less Morgan (a little of him goes a very, very, very long way) and far more in the way of a serial structure to the show.  As a result, my interest has gone up sharply.This episode picks up from the previous one, in which Sarah kissed Chuck, only to discover that her former lover/CIA partner Bryce was still alive.  Obviously, this complicates everything.  I'll keep the spoilers light except to add that the episode ends with Sarah being forced to choose between staying on her assignment with Chuck or going off with Bryce.  Given that she has a longterm contract on the show, there isn't a great deal of tension.  The question obviously isn't whether Sarah will end up staying, but under what conditions.I'm coming to like this show more and more as the ongoing story continues.  I'm really delighted that it has not persisted in offering nothing but standalone episodes.  I've mentioned in many reviews that the one massive advantage TV has over the movies is the serial format.  A TV series can develop a narrative and provide character development that no movie ever made can even remotely hope to match.  Shows that turn their backs on that natural superiority of TV to movies do not receive my respect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Continues a string of increasingly interesting episodes", "unixReviewTime": 1196121600, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2007"},

All the actors have been chosen with great care, and they interact with one another as though they had been working with eachother their entire lives. They have great chemistry in every scene, it's like they're best friends in real life. The show has alot of comedy which is only broken up by action and dramatic story telling. What I love about the show is it's many references to movies, television, and video games. Chuck is not James Bond, not even close in fact. It is hilarious watching him try to fit into the world of espionage. He does have two bodyguards Sarah and Casey to protect him. Sarah is a beautiful blonde agent that is sent to be his girlfriend (lucky guy), and Casey is the heavy artillery side of the team. It's really fun to see Chucks and Sarah's relationship grow throughout the season. They clearly have great chemistry and that leads to some romantic moments. It's sorta like on LOST with Jack and Kate you know they want to be with each other but the plot dictates otherwise just teasing you here and there. Chuck also has a best friend Morgan who is responsible for most of the laughs as we watch his pathetic life, and the way he clings to Chuck's every move. Chuck and his family really keep the show grounded and really relatable to the every day guy. This show began well and only got better in season 2.The picture quality is another thing all together. It has grain in almost every frame. The picture is just filled with noise almost the entire time. It really is distracting and is quite disappointing. Chuck surpasses the picture quality with it's amazing characters and stories. The extras are decent with some deleted scenes, a gag reel, and audition footage.  The series is a mix of Alias, Mission Impossible, and Get Smart.

Thurlow", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "\"Life: Season One\" is something completely different in a police procedural.  Charlie Crews is an L.A. cop who spent 12 years in prison for a mass murder for which he was framed.  Sprung from prison by a crusading attorney, Crews is back on the police force with a promotion to detective and a multi-million dollar legal settlement.The show operates on several levels.  Charlie Crews must readjust to life on the outside, where there is sunshine, fresh fruit, unfamiliar technology, and a large empty mansion to live in.  His wife and his former life are gone, although not entirely.  He approaches his new job from a unique angle, shaped by the Zen philosophy he adopted to survive inside.The police force has decidedly mixed feelings about his return; his new partner, Dani Reese, is a recovering substance abuser under pressure from their chain of command to find a excuse to get rid of him. She is also the daughter of a retired policeman who may have been responsible for Charlie's frame-up.The cases in each episodes would be fairly ordinary but for Charlie's Zen angle, which allows him both insight and compassion. In one heartwrenching confrontation, Charlie is forced to shoot an armed and dangerous suspect, then comforts the dying man by convincing him he is only having a bad dream.Charlie's secret crusade to unravel the conspiracy that put him in jail gives him ruthless enemies who seem uncannily aware of his every move.  Each episode teeters on the knife-edge tension that Charlie can be sent back to jail or even killed if he gets too close to the truth.  Charlie gets help from his former cellmate, a white collar criminal; his attorney, who dangerously mixes a professional and a personal relationship with Charlie; and his ex-wife, who has considerable guilt over divorcing Charlie in prison.\"Life: Season One\" is very highly recommended as a different kind of police procedural.  British actor Damian Lewis carries off Charlie Crews with a grounded, offbeat charm.  The early episodes are a little jarring, counterpointing Charlie's new life with the one he lost.  However, the series settles into a good rythmn, building to a hard-hitting season finale.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Something Completely Different...", "unixReviewTime": 1228694400, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2008"},

Bala \"Me Too Can Read\"", "helpful": [70, 75], "reviewText": "Prison changes a man, and it certainly changed former LAPD police officer Charlie Crews. From 1995 to 2007 he served hard time for murders he didn't commit. When DNA evidence surfaces proving his innocence, Crews is released and reinstated in the force (he also lands some serious settlement money). Now Detective Crews finds himself working with a new partner even as he covertly seeks answers to what the hell happened.LIFE looks to be a very promising cop detective show, and not because the mysteries themselves are dynamite stuff or anything. No, the viewing addiction lies in watching the lead actor work his craft. Britisher Damian Lewis is simply fabulous as the wounded, brooding protagonist, trying to piece his life back together. It's fun watching Crews apply his askewed perspective on his cases. I'm normally not a fan of folks who sling zen about, but Lewis makes it such a quirky and integral part of his character. And if it's a loose cannon with an agenda slinging that zen, all the better. After all, zen helped Crews survive the penitentiary. I also like the little touches which remind us that Crews is still coping with his new found freedom, whether it's his habit of munching on fresh fruit (they never have fresh fruit in prison) or his preference for light and open air or the fact that he still doesn't have furniture in his home.Lewis's supporting cast is so-so. I do enjoy Sarah Shahi, who's a former Dallas Cowboy cheerleader. She plays the no-nonsense Dani Reese, Crews' new partner and not ecstatic about it. It's true that her character tends to fall in the generic character-saddled-with-demons category, so, yeah, nothing new from that angle. But I think she has very good chemistry with Damian Lewis, and I just love her bemused or irritated reactions to Crews' barrage of philosophical quirk. Two other actors who nicely play off Lewis are sexy Brooke Langton as Crews' smitten attorney and Adam Arkin as Crews' former inmate and current best friend and financial adviser.I like the show's use of interview clips. They reveal certain insights and usher several sub-plots into the light. We learn, for instance, that Crews' former partner didn't stand up for him and that Crews' beautiful wife had divorced him while he was serving out his time. We even get a teeny whiff of the conspiracy surrounding Crews' frame-up. More layers and foreshadowings, thanks to these interview clips.SPOILERS now.With the steady influx of crime drama on TV, I wasn't planning on tuning in to this show. Then the pilot changed my mind. Other standout episodes? \"Powerless\" is the powerful sixth episode, focusing on Dani as she pursues a rapist who'd been haunting her AA meetings. \"Farthingale\" (episode 8) is a fun one, an intriguing mystery which begins with a man having been half blown off by an exploding stove. Then there's the intense two-part, season closing story arc (episodes 10 & 11: \"Dig A Hole\" & \"Fill It Up\") as Crews finally tracks down the man who committed the murders for which he was incarcerated. In \"Dig A Hole\" we also get to see a showdown of sorts between Crews' new and former partners.SPOILERS end.I can't stress enough how good Damian Lewis is on this show. I remember him from HBO's great wartime mini-series,Band of Brothers, and he made big noise back then, too, and was even nominated for a Golden Globe (although he didn't win). Damian Lewis, with his complex performance here, elevates LIFE from a humdrum procedural into a riveting police drama. And since NBC has already indicated that this wonderful drama series will be picked up for a second season, well, LIFE is good.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "\"Life was his sentence.

The pilot episode offers some background on a cop that was wrongly convicted of a crime. He is released and after negotiating a multi million dollar settlement with the Police Deaprtment goes back to work as a detective in the Police Department. He has a very zen approach to life and is trying to solve the crime for which he was convicted. His partner is a young woman that is a recovering addict. She has little patience for him and is suspect of his methods.Still, I found that the show was not compelling. I think it went over the top and released too much information on the first episode when they should have held back a little. Everyone loves a good mystery!Dani Reese's (the woman agent) emotional responses were confusing. On one hand, she has little patience for her new partner ready to disclose everything he does wrong to her superiors and at the end of the episode, protecting him. She seems overly emotional in some scenes and then stoic in others. She is a recovering addict. I would have disclosed Dani Reese's addiction history maybe a bit later. The show just needs better writing.Damian Lewis played his character well, if he was going for the quirky Zen guy. But, the way he speaks (an attempt by the writers to make him interesting) is not that compelling. He has no censor and that's ok. But, the writer's attempt is so transparent as to make every line that comes out of Crews (the main character played by Lewis) unbelievable.Claudia Black is a good actress, why they would recast her is beyond me.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Meh", "unixReviewTime": 1191542400, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2007"},

I &#34;found&#34; &#34;Life&#34; backtracking from &#34;Fairly Legal&#34;, another secret show, staring Sarah Shahi... and what a surprise to find Damian Lewis was the actual star which interested me because of his staring work on &#34;Homeland&#34;.  So, seriously, I backtracked into Life from more current shows.  I ran into Fairly Legal on &#34;Cloo&#34; channel.  They had a &#34;marathon&#34; of Fairly Legal and I wasn't really paying attention at first and became more and more involved until I just loved that show.  I searched for it only to discover... as always, a wonderful little show had been tossed out just when it was really hitting its stride.  I've given up on &#34;networks&#34; being bright enough to keep quality shows so these days I skulk in the back roads of the internet searching for entertainment jewels.... LIFE!Life is based on Damian Lewis's character Charlie Crews who was framed for murder as a cop and spent 12 years in prison.  He's later freed by discovered DNA evidence and FREEDOM + giant financial settlement + back to work as a detective as a settlement. You'd think, &#34;all about revenge&#34; but that, so far, appears to be a background, almost silent thread.  Sarah Shahi's talents, acting skills, and drop dead gorgeous looks are largely wasted but she adds some great dramatic tension as &#34;Crews&#34; new partner, Dani Reese.So far (Amazon is nagging me to review before I've completed the 1st season) Crews and Reese go about each show solving murders.  Crews pulls off an apparently complete Zen-new-age-self-help slightly demented from horrible prison experience, nice guy and Damian manages to pull off a stormy but silent darkness under the zen appearance. Reese (Shahi) has apparently been assigned as Crews's senior partner as some kind of unknown punishment and her sub plot appears to be to find a way to bounce Crews out of the police force but instead, very gradually through the season grows to believe he's sincerely a nice guy and a good cop.  There are plenty of plot curves for nearly all the characters that keeps the viewer 'coming back'.  I'm fortunate, I waited until it was cancelled so I'm already prepared for a fantastic 2nd season that flies off a cliff believing the &#34;next&#34; season that never happened would be even better still.Don't put a lot of stock in the idea that the show may not be worth watching because it is just another terrific show mangled by some money grubbers who didn't know they were about to hit the lottery.  Great characters, great actors being great characters, enough sub plots going on to always leave you curious for the next episode and nearly always an unexpected surprise.  Maybe Cloo will pick up a season of &#34;Life&#34; to marathon on some weekend like they did with &#34;Fairly Legal&#34; and folks will have a enough taste to find an alternate source, from networks, to enjoy &#34;Life&#34;.... a good TV series with at least two up and coming entertainment stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Backtracking into Life", "unixReviewTime": 1376006400, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2013"},

The Charlie Crews character, played by Damion Lewis was brilliantly acted and his partner, Detective Reese (Sarah Shahi), is equally as good. They are remarkably good together once they get passed all the &#34;issues&#34; each of them brings to the partnership. Adam Arkin adds humor as Ted Early, a white collar criminal, to the show as Charlie's old prison mate, whom he protected while they were in prison and invited to live with him and manage the huge settlement Charlie received for wrongful conviction. Charlie's old partner, Officer Bobby Stark, played by the ever fascinating Brent Sexton, rounds out the odd main character cast. Watching Charlie readjust to life outside prison, working with a new partner and solve cases has proved irresistible. Excellent acting by all in developing characters that, to me, are just too irresistible and engaging.

Such is the case with BIONIC WOMAN.This remake of the hit 70s show that starred Lindsey Wagner (that was a spin off of THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN) updates the original, keeping only what's necessary. Jamie Sommers is young, in love and pregnant. After breaking the news to her boyfriend Will (Chris Bowers), the pair are broadsided on the way home.Damaged to the extent that she might die, Jamie is saved by Will as his true occupation is revealed. The man she thought was a simply college professor actually is a brilliant surgeon who works for a secret government agency. And rather than lose Jamie, Will takes her to their facility and enhances her.While her legs, one arm, one ear and one eye were completely obliterated, this facility replaces them with bionic parts, mechanical computerized parts as well as nano technology that boost her healing. Horrified at first, Jamie begins to accept the new her. When Will is killed by the last candidate for bionics, Sarah Corvus (Katee Sackhoff), Jamie joins the agency that rebuilt her.That's the simple set up for the series. Super strength, eyesight, hearing and more. Working for a government agency. And with a revenge motive strong enough to fill any number of stories. But the series doesn't stop there. As well as her new found life, Jamie has a kid sister to raise. Troublesome and a handful, the teen was dropped at her doorstep by her father and was the reason Jamie stayed where she is. A combination of love and loss revolve between the two.The series takes a natural progression, from Jamie being talked into her new career path to how she deals with Sarah. The series shows her progression, her training and her learning to deal with her abilities. But what makes this series work best is that it's not a straight out remake. Instead, it takes those bones from the original and makes the story it's own.Michelle Ryan stars as Jamie and does a fantastic job, showing a young woman who takes what life throws at her and survives. Miguel Ferrer does his smarmy best as the cold hearted bureaucrat who's in charge. Sackhoff is equally casts as the killer who wants to change but has technology that wasn't perfected within her.Cost of living what it is, there is no way Jamie can have been made for a mere $6 million. Times have changed and so has this show. But that's a good thing. While the original seems silly to look back on now, science fiction fans can find much to enjoy in this one.

The show just doesn't tie in things together.The show has a very nice visual style (hence my rating of 3 stars) and I think it has some potential, but a lot of things have to be fixed. These facilities, very low budget by the way, where she trains have really bad security and look like a basement. They should vamp up these settings and make them more hi-tech.

Someone needs to wake her up and say \"Woman, you are Bionic! React! I would also like to know how she knows all these fighting techniques. Was some computer implanted into her head?

And in an age when writing on television on TV is reaching such high standards, it's a shame that in the end it's the writing that lets this down.It's also worth remembering that if you plan to purchase this, it is only EIGHT episodes - yes, that includes the pilot.  So Jaime Sommers is in a car accident, gets her limbs, eye and ear replaced with superior bionic parts by a covert group who go around saving the world each week.  Hangers on include her younger sister who lives with her and knows nothing of her secret life, and later, a boyfriend.

The widely reported rumor is that there has been disarray on the set of the show.  The good news is that NBC seems to be a big believer in the show and has taken every possible effort to make it a success.  The other bit of good news is that the show is already quite good, even if in disarray.  Now, it is also perfectly possible that things were confused on the set, but that many of the difficulties were solved by excellent editing.  But if one didn't know from other sources that the production is supposed to be a bit of a mess, you wouldn't be able to tell by the finished episode.  After a few episodes show runner Glen Morgan left the show.  Jason Katims, who is the executive producer of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, has been taken on as a consulting producer.  I've read also that a number of FNL writers have gotten involved with THE BIONIC WOMAN.  NBC clearly thinks this show could be a hit for several years.Clearly, NBC's reaction to THE BIONIC WOMAN shows the beginning of a trend in responding to productions that have some onset confusion.  The prototype was last year's BROTHERS AND SISTERS, which by all accounts was simply a god awful mess.  The initial show runner quit over creative differences (she is now the show runner, ironically, for the show that runs opposite THE BIONIC WOMAN, ABC's PRIVATE PRACTICE) and NBC was forced to put together a new production team.  The result was a completely rejuvenated program, one that by the end of the year was enjoying both respect by critics and dedication by fans (of which, I must confess, I am not one).All of which excites me.  If THE BIONIC WOMAN is this good while the production team was not a smooth running machine, what will it be like once it is tuned up?This episode lays out what will clearly be a major story arc on the show, the strained but unbreakable connection between Jaime Sommers and Sarah Corvus.  Some people have complained about Michelle Ryan's performance as Jaime, but I think she has been fine and that she will get even better as her character is allowed to develop more confidence.  I think the problem is not Michelle Ryan, but that Katee Sackhoff's performance as Sarah Corvus is just so spectacularly good that she makes everyone around her look bad in comparison.  Sarah Corvus dominates every scene she is in, much the way that on BUFFY Faith and Spike tended to take over when they put in an appearance.My one concern with the series at this point is how good it is going to be when we get less Sarah Corvus.  THE BIONIC WOMAN started filming before BATTLESTAR GALACTICA did, so that Katee Sackhoff, who plays Starbuck on the latter, was available for early episodes.  At some point we will inevitably see less Sarah.  My understanding is that Sackhoff's boss, David Eick, is working with her to keep her involved with THE BIONIC WOMAN as much as possible while BSG wraps up and having both shows film in Vancouver certainly helps.  Still, at least for a while Sarah will have to play a diminished role.  But one thing seems certain:  no performer on television will play such a crucial role on two series this year as Katee Sackhoff.All in all, I think this episode was a big improvement over the second one.

In the fifth season, the show experiences several additional such tonal shifts, as Chuck is betrayed by his best friend (but it turns out not to be his fault) and, most surprisingly, has his life almost ruined in the final few episodes of the series. For a show that's always been quite warm-hearted and entertainingly cheesy, the surprisingly bleak tone of the final few episodes comes as a bit of a shock.The season - renewed purely to be wrapped up - only consists of thirteen episodes and it appears there may have been budgetary restrictions in place: our previous season villains were played by well-known actors such as Chevy Chase and Timothy Dalton. This year we get Angus Macfadyen, a very solid Scottish actor best-known for his supporting role in Braveheart (as Robert the Bruce). He does a good job, but lacks the geek-cred his predecessors brought with them. Even more problematic is the fact that he only appears in the last few episodes of the season with little build-up and his character is never really explored in much depth (in contrast to Dalton's hammy-but-complex Volkoff).The truncated run causes issues throughout the season. Storylines that would have been given whole episodes to develop in the second through fourth seasons are here disposed off way too quickly. An entertaining on-going subplot involving Carrie-Ann Moss as a rival contractor (and potential romantic interest for Casey) has enormous potential, but kind of peters out with no real climax or pay-off. Most frustratingly, there is relatively very little action in the Buy More. Big Mike, Lester and Jeff barely get any lines in some episodes, although a late-season subplot that sees Lester and a reformed and sober Jeff finally discovering what's going under their feet does help reduce this problem a little.Most surprising is a divisive late-season storyline involving amnesia. Given the tone of the show, I was confidently expecting some last-minute solution or cure would be found. Instead, we get a highly inconclusive ending. It's not quite The Sopranos, but the series ending without ever answering the central question poised by the last couple of episodes is an unexpected and possibly even brave choice. Whether it's the right choice is one that fans will be arguing about for years to come (or unless the much-rumoured Chuck movie gets off the ground). For myself, Chuck has always been first and foremost an escapist and fun show, not a gritty drama like the new BSG or something from HBO. Ending the show in this manner feels out of character for the series, and a little bit of pointless torture for our main characters who really deserved more of a happy ending.That aside, the final season of Chuck (***) is entertaining, well-acted and often quite funny. The shortened episode order means some storylines aren't developed very well, and the ending will be divisive, but certainly the season is worth watching for established fans. In particular, the way Chuck's character develops across the five seasons, going from nerd to an intelligent, resourceful agent (exemplified by the shots of Chuck on the DVD spines, which cleverly show this development) does pay off very well here.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A divisive ending, but a lot of fun to be had on the way", "unixReviewTime": 1363910400, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2013"},

Thurlow", "helpful": [80, 91], "reviewText": "For the final season of \"Chuck\", producers Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak faced a daunting dramatic challenge: how to generate new drama, comedy and romance for a great show.  After all, at the end of season four, nice guy CIA agent Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levy) finally married his lovely CIA partner Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), after protecting the birth of niece Clara to sister Ellie and brother-in-law Captain Awesome.  Operation Bartkowski was officially ended, leaving Chuck, Sara, gruff NSA agent John Casey (Adam Baldwin), and Chuck's best friend Morgan (Joshua Gomez) without a mission.  The solution: reshuffle the deck.Using money from Alexei Volkov, last season's leading villain, Chuck, Sara, Casey, and Morgan go into the private spy business, only to discover the competition can be quite fierce.  Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix) has a recurring role as the cutthroat leader of a rival firm, and as someone with a history, and maybe a future, with Casey.  Morgan, who ended up last season with the Intersect in his head, discovers the hard way the challenges of having super spy skills, and in the process damages his relationship with Casey's daughter Alex.  Chuck, reduced to basic nice guy computer nerd, goes through his own period of painful adjustment, before having to face his greatest opponent one more time.  Sara Walker's long-missing mother will make an appearance at a vital moment, while fans will be treated to additional fun with the BuyMore gang, and to additional Bartkowski family comedy (and drama over Chuck and Sara's future).Team Bartkowski will face a series of threats from rogue CIA agents, including one who sets up the team for the crime of the century, leaving the team with a choice of jail or life on the run.  In a tense multi-episode conclusion, Chuck and Sara will battle one last ruthless opponent for control of the Intersect and everything they have built together.  The suspense will be good to the last drop.\"Chuck: The Complete Fifth Season\" has the last 13 episodes of the show and is highly recommended to its dedicated fans.

And, for such an underdog show like CHUCK, really, a five year run is pretty amazing. I'm already missing this show bad. But at least EUREKA is still around for a few more seasons... wait, what's that about EUREKA?In the course of four years, Chuck Bartowski's evolution has been an eye-opener, Chuck having gone from hapless Nerd Herder to accomplished spy. This fifth and final season finds him coping without the crutch of the Intersect and proving that, just on his own merit and innate skills and savvy, he's still got the goods to kick bu++ in the cloak and dagger community. As noted in last season's finale, thanks to Volkoff's largesse, Chuck and Sarah are now stinking rich. They now own the Burbank Buy More store, still the cover for Castle, their underground espionage lair. With the CIA giving them the stink eye, Chuck and Sarah have struck out on their own and established their own independent security firm. But maybe the biggest \"What the--?!\" moment in last season's finale is that Morgan Grimes has become the inadvertent host of the Intersect. It's a fun twist, initially. But I think we were all laying odds that this sitch wouldn't last.Foremost, I love the show's heart. We eyeball the shadowy conspiracies and the neat spy gadgets and the skullduggery and the wicked kung fu bits, but these elements rapidly become rote when you don't give a what about the characters. It's always been about Sarah and Chuck. They anchor things. It's sappy to say, but despite the geektastic pyrotechnics, it's Sarah and Chuck's romantic arc that we track and feed off from the most. Sarah Walker, who once was this lonely little girl, unwilling to trust, weapons always hot. Chuck Bartowski, hapless geek, heart ever on his sleeve. Their winding love story is pretty friggin' sweet. And, to squeaze out that last drip of dramatic conflict and tension, even in (especially in) the eleventh hour, the showrunners are all too willing to jeopardize Sarah and Chuck's happiness. Yeah, okay, it hooked me in yet again. From jump I cared about these characters. That even eventually applied to the aggravating sidekick Morgan Grimes.Season 5's first major arc deals with Morgan as the new walking CIA database and touches on Chuck's trying hard not to feel too envious or useless. And, somewhere on the periphery, never quite going away, skulks yet another dark cabal out to destroy Chuck. There's a rogue CIA operative targeting our nerd. And Chuck and Sarah's newfound wealth... well, this show's writers just love erecting obstacles for our protagonists.Our spy team for hire has trouble staying solvent. Doesn't help that Chuck and company are in direct competition with the flashier Verbanski Corps, of which boss, Gertrude Verbanski, seems to harbor a personal agenda against Colonel Casey. CHUCK has always had a knack for attracting guest actors steeped in nerd pop culture. This season's guest star bounty includes Mark Hamill, the reprising Linda Hamilton, Rebecca Romijn, Stan Lee (as himself), Bo Derek (as herself), two cast members from COMMUNITY, as well as a welcome recurring run for Carrie-Anne Moss who plays the steely Gertrude Verbanski.With only 13 episodes, this season focuses less on silly shenanigans at the Buy More. Still, fans of Jeffster shouldn't fret. Jeffrey gets a pretty gratifying story arc, and there's a very nice payoff regarding Jeffster in the final episode.My pick of the season: \"Chuck vs. the Zoom,\" for demonstrating Chuck's improvisational tactical skills, and this without the Intersect; \"Chuck vs. the Curse,\" because of Ellie and Captain Awesome's fun and unexpectedly perilous date night; \"Chuck vs. the Baby,\" for shedding more light on Sarah's past; \"Chuck vs. Bo,\" because friggin' Bo Derek's in it; and \"Chuck vs. the Goodbye,\" for all the callbacks and because it's a fine send-off, never mind that we have to infer the happy ending.I dunno, maybe this is a good time for CHUCK to bow out, before it starts flirting with becoming too stale. And maybe I'm getting fed up with buying them Subway sandwiches. But, man, I will miss this show something fierce.

The writers and actors knew this as well and pulled out all the stops for the end of this saga. I thought season four was good but a little lacking when compared to the previous seasons. This season however was excellent. The guest stars were impressive as always with Carrie Anne Moss, Mark Hammil, Bo Derek, and many others that made for a pop culture flashback. This season centered on Carmichael industries and how Chuck, Sarah, and Casey were on there own. Oh and also Morgan has the Intersect and Chuck does not. I was a little worried about how this would play out but the writers did an excellent job giving the storyline meaning and depth. I won't go into detail but it was an interesting ride with Morgan Grimes having the Intersect.Also Chuck and Sarah shared a lot of post marriage problems like starting a family and finding a house. It was cool to see these two try to figure out married life while shooting some bad guys. Casey gets a love interest in Carrie Anne Moss which was a nice touch for the gruff Colonel, and wouldn't you know it there was a Matrix reference added for her. The ending while a little controversial was excellent in my opinion. Anyone about to watch the finale should watch the pilot right before it. There are a lot of references to Chuck's first mission. There will also be an extended version of the finale along with audio commentary for the episode (It's about time). Even if you didn't like the finale at least the writers got to end the show on their terms.I'm rating this in advance of buying it because I think we all know it isn't going to look great on Blu Ray. It never has been the standard for high definition. I doubt things will change now. This will be however is the best it is going to look for a while so I will gladly add it to my collection next to the previous four seasons.The final season of Chuck was a wild ride until the final smash to black. It brought back a lot of favorite characters including a previous villain, new characters were seamlessly added to the mix, and the focus never shifted too far from the main cast. Which did an excellent job once again. Zachary Levi deserves an Emmy for his performance in the finale. I said the same for Matthew Fox for LOST and he was robbed. I hope Chuck at least gets a nomination. The final episode will be debated for a long time, but you owe it to yourself to experience the final season of Chuck.

The stories flow together creating a nice arc of the family interactions and current cultural dynamics mixed with good sci-fi based on quantium theory that the viewer can actually believe. There is a balance between the good that Dan does and the sinister aspect of being watched by the government in recent story lines.

Dedicated fans of the sitcom were sat wondering what to do next. Myself alike, we simply didn't know what to do with ourselves, we searched frantically for an equally intelligent sitcom alternative which simply didn't exist. Some of us suffered withdrawal symptoms and eventually got over them, while others simply withered away and died whilst huddling in a corner rocking back and forth waiting for \"Frasier\" to come back. He never did.Three years later and Chuck Lorre finally came to the rescue and brought us the utterly fantastic \"Big Bang Theory.\" No, not the theory of the beginning of the universe and everything in it, but rather the most fantastically amusing and intelligent situational comedy to grace our screens since the equally fantastic \"Frasier.\" It's a show much like Frasier that doesn't seek to just pop out one gag at a time, much like a stand up comedy performance, more rather it will create a genuinely hysterical situation from the simplest of things. It is made this amusing thanks to the fantastic writing, acting and non-patronising tone of the whole thing.The show is primarily based around four super intelligent stereotypical nerds and their blonde bimbo neighbour played by the wonderful Kaley Cuoco. The four nerds are the closest of friends and comprise of Sheldon played by Jim Parsons, Leonard played by Johnny Galecki, Howard played by Simon Helberg and Rajesh played by Kunal Nayyar. Each character has their own fantastic quirks that makes them individually a quality addition to the whole ensemble. Specifically Sheldon who is the genuine super genius of the group that contains not an ounce of modesty about his intelligence or his work. Parsons presents an almost seemless character that exhibits the general unease in modern society that you would expect from someone of such an academic nature, yet amongst his peers  exhumes a confidence that portrays an obvious annoyance amongst his room mate and closest friends.Looking at the general synopsis of the show you would be forgiven for thinking that it's a simple \"boy meets girl, boy likes girl, but girl is too good for boy, but boy doesn't realise it so keeps chasing her.\" Throughout a lot of the first season this is definitely portrayed, but it done in such a subtle way that it avoids the annoyance that would no doubt make it a cliche.  This is more about the intelligent banter between the two main friends of the four, Sheldon and Leonard. Leonard is the more down to Earth character, and although a bit of an outcast in his own right, feels the embarassment that such heightened levels of intelligence and geekyness that he possesses which Sheldon seems to look past.Much like \"Frasier\", this presents an extremely intelligent cast and some genuinely good acting along with presenting the prolongued fish out of water idea rather than weekly random situation that would create a string of gags. The acting within is superb and although the characters may seem quite transparent, there's the potential to have much more depth revealed from within. Kaley Cuoco is the unlikely candidate for this as although the last time I personally saw her was playing generally the same type of character in \"8 Simple Rules\", she expresses genuine potential of a great actress and she displayed her great acting skills in the scenes of \"8 Simple Rules\" following the untimely death of the legend John Ritter. Although that may have been fueled by genuine emotion, she delivered her lines with the same confidence and prowess we had become used to whilst playing to the Daughter who lost her Father story.If we get some emotional scenes, then I expect her to be on the front lines of acting within them. Other than the want of some genuine emotion, there's nothing negative I can say about this show. Throughout it uses a genuinely intelligent script that doesn't patronise the viewer by trying to explain everything they're talking about, or presenting a \"moral of the story is...\" angle to each episode. It gets a strong recommendation and I have to ask that if you haven't seen it already, then the question has to be asked.

What a wonderful and hilarious series coming from the minds of Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady.The series is about two physicists Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons) who live in an apartment together.  One day, they get a new neighbor with Penny, a blonde and beautiful woman from Nebraska who has come to California for a better life but after a bad breakup, finds friendship with Leonard and his friends.Joining Leonard and Sheldon are their two best friends Howard (Simon Helberg), a perverted and horny brainiac and Rajesh (Kunal Nayyar), another brainiac but has a problem with his inability to speak with beautiful girls.What makes this comedy work so well are the character dynamics and each of their quirks.  Especially the character of Sheldon who is just the most anal geek among the three but Parson's Sheldon just is incredible.  Included in this season 1 box set are a total of 17 episodes.1. Pilot - Penny moves into the building and Leonard who is smitten by her agrees to get back her TV from her muscle-bound ex.2. The Big Bran Hypothesis - Leonard is addicted to cleanliness and organization and can't stand Penny's messy room, so he sneaks into her room during the early morning to organize her room.3. The Fuzzy Boots Corollary - Leonard has a date with Penny but she doesn't know it's a date.4. The Luminous Fish Effect - Sheldon gets fired from work and decides to stay at home, concocting experiments and annoying everyone.5. The Hamburger Postulate - Leonard's not sure if he'll ever become Penny's boyfriend, so he and a fellow co-worker decide to have sex, while Sheldon doesn't know what to do when his roommate is having sex in their apartment.6. The Middle Earth Paradigm - Penny's having a Halloween party and all the guys are invited including her ex who picks on Leonard.7. The Dumpling Paradox - What happens when Howard gets lucky with Penny's friend?8. The Grasshopper Experiment - Rajesh finds a way to get over his inability to speak to a woman but what happens when his parents plan an arranged marriage and he has to meet with this woman.9. The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization - Leonard and Sheldon are invited to present their physics findings but instead leads to a fight between the two.10. The Loobenfeld Decay - Sheldon can't tell a lie, so he puts Leonard in a odd situation.11. The Pancake Batter Anomaly - Sheldon is sick and the guys start to panic and go in hiding, leaving Sheldon with Penny.12. The Jerusalem Quality - A child prodigy comes to the campus and Sheldon is feeling threatened by him.13. The Bat Jar Conjecture - It's time for the physics bowl team and Sheldon is the MVP.14. The Nerdvana Ahhihilation - What happens when Leonard orders a (very large) time machine from a film.15. The Pork Chop Indeterminacy - Sheldon's twin arrives and the guys fall for her.16. The Peanut Reaction - It's Leonard's birthday but what happens when he and Wolowitz get an allergic reaction from eating peanuts.17. The Tangerine Factor - Leonard and Penny go on their first date.AUDIO AND VIDEO:The audio is stereo and nothing major since the show is primarily all dialogue.  As for the video, the earlier episodes has a bit of graininess to it.  I thought maybe playing the disc on a Blu-ray player maybe showing a lot of noise but I checked the disc on another player and it seems that the first few episodes just had a bit of it.  But fortunately, not all of it are like that.  If anything, you see it moreso on the pilot.SPECIAL FEATURES:The DVD box set unfortunately doesn't have too many special features.  Included is a featurette titled \"Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory: A Behind-the-Scenes Look Into Geek Chic\".  The 20-minutes featurette features interviews with the creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady and also the cast.What I found interesting about the featurette was learning how the show was created, how the actors were selected and the use of science in the show.I've always wondered what would happen on television with a lot of the sitcoms now nearly all gone from television except on syndication.  But I have to admit that Monday nights on CBS has become my favorite night thanks to \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"How I Met Your Mother\".I have to admit that \"The Big Bang Theory\" is just so enjoyable to me because of my enjoyment of super heroes, comic books,  technology, video games, science, etc.  Although these guys are more on the extremeness of geekiness, I can't help but love the show.  It's absolutely one of the best sitcoms right now and for a comedy series, I don't think I have laughed so much since \"Seinfeld\".You can find this season 1 set for a great price and I definitely recommend this TV series!

Perhaps that's why this show has such a following: many brainy types find themselves torn between wanting to fit into the human race, and having little interest in being ordinary.  I teach at the university level, so I see this basic pattern play out among my colleagues every working day.Leonard has fallen for Penny, the pretty aspiring actress living across the hall.  Sheldon has a very narrow range of interests, in which he continually tries to improve himself, but little concern for anything outside his comfort zone.  Leonard would love to shut off the ideas constantly whizzing around his brain.  Sheldon would love to shut off the world and retreat into those ideas for the rest of his life.  Neither one can have what he wants.These brainiacs attract a huge audience, I contend, because real-life brainy types have both these paradigms at play simultaneously.

All the elements of this show hit every nail on the head for me. A funny show that mixes elevated humor with more crude humor and actually has a developing story line. Who would have thought this would be a good idea? Oh yeah, the guy behind Two and a Half Men, the show that present humor to the lowest common denominator of humanity, whoda thunk it? This is an amazingly well thought out show in the respect of the characters, while presenting certain character archetypes, which I'm sure will be mined for comedy gold in later seasons, we aren't left with mere empty shells of characters. Instead we actually get to love each character individually by the writers presenting the negative side to each characters oddity. Whether it be Sheldon's staunchness in his character and inability to easily adapt to new situations to Rajesh's inability to communicate with those of the female gender, we're presented with characters who are extremely intelligent but also deeply flawed, creating a situation that is hard to parallel and also hard to make a strong comparison to within this genre. While granted the show does still present itself within the sitcom genre and many of it's tropes, it manages to elevate itself above that with some intelligent writing and some brilliantly acted characters. Sadly the main female lead found in Penny is strongly lacking for me in many regards (let's see if they develop that later on) she is somewhat counter balanced by minor side characters like Leslie Winkle, is this enough to alleviate the bimboness that is Penny at times, obviously not but the end of the first season does lead toward some character develop in that regard. I'm excited that I've finally started to watch this show because I've long felt that with a handful of exceptions (Modern Family, the first few seasons of Raising Hope, 30 Rock - who now that I think about it have much stronger female characters) the sitcom genre is dying a painful death in front of our eyes.

It's a simple set with a single Blu-Ray format case housing first the Blu discs, then the DVDs, and coming with a single UV redemption code for the whole season in high def.It comes with a couple bonus features on both the Blu / DVD discs (last disc, I think?)...Overall, I like the execution. I think this is how things should generally be released going forward. Kudos on that, WB! Blu for high def, DVD for low-def or for sharing with friends who haven't yet upgraded and UV for online streaming or downloadable personal digital copy. Kind of like future-proofing. Makes sense to me.However, I'll note that, for whatever reason, the 'high def' video quality doesn't seem all that great. Especially watching on UV via VUDU (haven't tried yet via CinemaNow to see if the same problems persist via a different UV ecosystem provider). It's especially apparent on the pilot episode, but seems endemic. While it's high def there seem to be lots of compression artifacts abounding making he picture look pretty poor quality, especially noticeable on my 60\" TV when you get right up close. It looks pretty bad...So, I put in the Blu-Ray just to compare. It looks *a bit better* on Blu-Ray proper, but there's still quite a bit of graininess. So, I'm a bit disappointed. I don't know if it's 'cause the original was shot at lower def and upgraded, or whether the transfer just wasn't done cleanly from film or whatever.I haven't yet looked closely at season 2 Blu's yet to see if the problems persist with the transfer. I'll take a look more closely at some point and find out.Overall, though, I love the set and the show itself. And since one sits the better part of 8-10 feet away from the screen the artifacts aren't terribly noticeable at that distance. Right up close it's VERY noticeable, especially streaming, probably due to compression algorithms being somewhat 'lossy?' But I can forgive it sin ethe overall set is great.Can't wait for Seasons 3-4 to update to the Blu+DVD+UV format, since it looks like they were originally released in Blu-only format (no DVD or UV). Once you ship 'em that way (combo pack), I'll pick 'em up, very few questions asked. As long as they're done as well as these are. I'm all for it! And the combo-ness is a good thing, sinec my friend who loves the show hasn't yet upgraded to a Blu-ray player and he LOVES the show too, so with the combo pack, we can still enjoy them over at his place and laugh our butts off for hours on end.

I first have to confess that sitcoms are my dead bottom least favorite genre of show.  I barely make room for HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, but all in all it is a format that I find pretty dreadful, on the same level of reality and talent shows and crime procedurals.  I hate the limitations of the camera work, the lack of character development, and -- the worst invention in the history of television -- the laugh track.  Moreover, Season One of TBBT did not get the formula quite right.  Much of it was that they hadn't sufficiently found ways to soften Sheldon's character, who can at times be very funny but at other times -- especially in this season -- be excruciatingly irritating.Season Two saw a number of subtle alterations of the show, mainly softening Sheldon, but also increasing the dynamics between the various characters.  But Season One felt slightly off to me.  I can't help but contrast it somewhat with HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.  The latter almost acknowledges the limitations of the format and constantly stretches it, including a pretty large number of exterior shots on the Warner Brothers lot.  The show also uses their laugh track much more lightly than TBBT.  Both shows suffer from too small of a cast (a common problem with sitcoms).  The  best comedies are not sitcoms, don't have laugh tracks, are not restricted to sound stages, and have large ensemble casts (cf. MODERN FAMILY, 30 ROCK, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, PARTY DOWN, early SCRUBS, and THE OFFICE).On the other hand, it is fun seeing a show with lots of nerd references.  Plus, I've actually known a couple of people who were geniuses along the line of Sheldon (though I should say that perhaps my greatest nerd moment was that when I worked in the University of Chicago Bookstore -- before it became a Barnes & Noble -- Chandrasekhar would always do a beeline to me to get help finding books [hey, having a world class genius -- another Nobel Prize winning physicist told me that in his opinion Chandrasekhar would rank as one of the two great twentieth century physicists after Einstein -- acknowledge your competence on books, even as a lowly book clerk, and nod to you as you walk across the campus may be a faint form of achievement, but if you don't understand this you don't understand the guys on TBBT]).  And as a comic book lover it is fun seeing a show with a lot of references to comics (though they seem to be limited entirely to superhero comics, while that makes up only part of my interest in comics).  But all of this was not quite enough to overcome the sitcom limitations, the laugh track, and irritating way that Sheldon was written in Season One.  The good news is that Season Two represented a huge improvement.

Probably not much but I'll try.Though the Complete First Season has been released before, a new \"Combo Pack\" is now out (as of July 10th) with both Blu-ray AND DVD versions plus the new Ultra Violet concept - all in one package. (So you will never be without a chance to watch these episodes again and again.). For those folks who complained that the only \"bonus\" in the original First Season set was the \"Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory\" featurette, you'll be happy to know that they added a gag reel this time. I'm not sure that is enough to replace your earlier set but it's a nice bonus for those - like me - just discovering it.There's no reason to go into the plot of the show - again, it's covered in other reviews - but I did notice that after the first for or five episodes (which at 22 minutes - no commercials - are like potato chips: you can't stop with just one) the characters changes in odd ways. Leonard seems less nerdy and Penny less overtly sexy (plus she must have lost her job at The Cheesecake Factory because by the fourth episode or so she is serving the \"guys\" at a local hamburger place in a non-TCCF uniform.The ONLY thing I found a bit of a downer - and I don't see it mentioned in other reviews - is that the series uses a \"laugh track\" which was very popular in the 1960s before TV comedies started being recorded in front of live audiences. It is really annoying because it sounds phony and you will hear the same laughter over and over, sometimes even before the punch line. It bothered me a lot during the first three episodes but I guess I got used to it a little as time went on.

Created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, it understandably took a little while for the creative team to develop the personalities of the characters.  But once the basic parameters were set, The Big Bang Theory began to boldly go where no comedy has gone before.With characters that always seem to be evolving, the series explores some unusual topics, and frequently heads into uncharted territory, usually making it impossible to predict what may happen.  This is one of the main reasons why this unique, goofy, show is so hilarious and captivating.  The creative team taps into facets of pop culture that may be associated with geeks and nerds (and teenage boys in general), and find ways to weave them into their stories, often in an exaggerated way.  Science fiction, comic books, superheroes, video games, television, action figures, paint ball fights, Star Wars, and the Star Trek universe, are just a few of the subjects that are featured.The cast is marvelous, with Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hofstadter, the shy guy enchanted by his new neighbor.  Jim Parsons is Sheldon Cooper.  If you look up the word neurotic, Sheldon's photo just might be there.  Simon Helberg is Howard Wolowitz, the delusional sleaze, who does still have his good points.  Kunal Nayyar is Rajesh Koothrappali, who can't speak to a beautiful woman unless he is under the influence of alcohol.  Kaley Cuoco is Penny, the girl from Omaha who moved next door, works at the Cheesecake Factory . . . . and changed their universe.Since Sheldon is off the scale when it comes to weirdness (what Penny would later come to describe as `whackadoodle'), and Wolowitz and Raj are arguably more `abnormal', Leonard seems the most sensible of the bunch.  Sheldon is totally unique, so bizarre in his beliefs, behavior and speech, that he seems at times to be from another planet.  Jim Parsons is a amazing comic talent, with a bright, bright future.Penny has a multi-faceted role.  One is as the primary female character, another is that she usually represents as close to a 'normal' persons' point of view as we will get.  As a link to reality, she is often the reference that shows just how wacked out the guys really are.  The times when she joins them in their world (such as when she fragged Sheldon on Halo night), are often some of the program's funniest moments.  By the end of the season, everything about the show is clearly peaking.  In `The Pancake Batter Anomaly', Sheldon gets sick, and Penny gets stuck taking care of him, rubbing Vaporub on his chest, and singing `Soft Kitty'.  In `The Bat Jar Conjecture', it's Sheldon's team versus the rest of the gang and Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), in the Physics Bowl.  Sheldon's knockout of a twin sister arrives and makes waves, in `The Pork Chop Indeterminacy'.  Sheldon gets a look in the mirror, in `The Jerusalem Duality' when a young genius arrives on campus.  In `The Nerduana Annihilation', when Leonard buys the time machine used in the classic 60's film `The Time Machine' on eBay, Penny's  astute description is that `It looks like something that Elton John would drive through the Everglades'.  In the season finale, there's a glimmer of hope for romance for Leonard, in `The Tangerine Factor' when Penny agrees to go out with him.The Big Bang Theory is simply one of the most engaging comedies to come along in years.  Each episode seems to fly by, and leave you wanting more.  Some commentary tracks would have been cool, but the only bonus is the `Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory' a look at the creators, cast, and genesis of the show.  There are only seventeen episodes in the First Season due to the writers' strike.Things only get better in the second season, as the show's creative team continue to develop the characters, and introduce new elements to the mix, keeping things fresh and extremely funny.  As Sheldon Cooper might say, it is a foregone conclusion that the third season will be characterized by the same outstanding writing, and brilliantly quirky humor found in the first two seasons, continuing to keep The Big Bang Theory, at the cutting edge of contemporary comedy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "much more than just a theory . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1245888000, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2009"},

I wasn't hooked until I saw the episode in which Sheldon and Leslie Winkle (Leonard's girlfriend at the moment) engage in an argument over the relative merits of String Theory and Quantum Gravity.  I had been involved in a discussion with one of my fellow scientists regarding this very same topic only days before viewing this episode--and the points that we addressed were almost the same as those articulated by the characters.  I had never seen a TV show where the characters actually talked about the same things that we real scientists do--and actually in an intelligent manner!  That said, not all statements voiced by the characters regarding physics are sensible or realistic.Of course, this is a TV comedy--not a documentary!  Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, and the rest of the crew, Physicists and other Ph.D.-bearing scientists and engineers who reside in the real world have little interest in comic books and superheroes.  In fact, of the thousands of scientists who I have known, only one ever expressed a great interest in comic books or superheroes.  Although people with such graduate degrees have generally seen movies and TV shows featuring such staples as Star Trek, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings, I am not sure that they view them more often than the general public.  Most scientists I know are more interested in the sports teams of their hometowns, music (both popular and classical), politics, and literature.  It is probably true, however, that scientists read more science fiction novels than the general public.Like Leonard, most scientists would indeed count themselves lucky to have a charming girlfriend like his lovely neighbor Penny played by Kaley Cuoco--and her often insightful character provides an important counterpoint to the book-smart but socially awkward scientists across the hall.  Her character is also admirable for her many clever and humorous remarks.  She is even able to eventually appreciate the somewhat obscure in-jokes of her scientist neighbors!  I should also observe that some scientists and engineers do have to ability to surround themselves with attractive women--and it is such smooth operators who become department heads at universities or government research labs!It has also come to my attention that this TV show was nearly the biggest topic of conversation for physicists attending the 2012 March Meeting of the American Physical Society!

Foreman quit because he didn't want to become House, Cameron quit because it was time for a change and Chase was fired. I know a lot of dedicated fans felt this was a big mistake, as these were characters that we had fallen in love with and didn't want to say goodbye to. Season 3 left us with a message that it was time for a change. Let me tell you that this change was awesome. Starting with episode 1 of season 4, House is alone in his office and hasn't worked since he lost his team. Determined to get House to hire new staff, Cuddy sets him a challenge. Cure his patient alone and he doesn't have to hire a team, otherwise if he can't figure out what's wrong on his own, he must hire a team. House loses the bet and episode one ends with House in a room of 40 doctors hoping to be on the team.Season 3, in a way was one of the more emotional seasons when testing his friendship with Wilson and testing his previous teams loyalty. Season 4 was more of a relief from that drama, with which some people may not like, but I truly loved. The first few episodes became a reality TV type show in which House would test his 40 possible employees and fire the ones that failed. Over this time we started to become aware of who the team would eventually be and what their quirks and personalities were.With the comic relief of the first few episodes, the finale presents us with a real tear jerker and possibly the most emotional episodes we have ever seen from the show. Wilson falls in love with one of House's former possible employees, but the finale tests their love as his girlfriend is taken critically ill. Robert Sean Leonard really shines in the finale and next to the sensible man we've come to know and love, he gives us a real emotional side. The two part finale is something brilliantly made that no fan will be disappointed with. I find that even with the writers strike, we were still given the most triumphant season finale from the entire show.Along with that I can't help but think that they had plans to have the old team re-unite at the end of season four. Unfortunately we wouldn't get to see that at the end of season four. I hope we really do get to see this situation arise in season five, although the team aren't completely gone. Cameron is in E.R., Chase is now a surgeon and Foreman is back and working for House already. In this season we were given a further development between the relationship of Cuddy and House. I'm hoping that in season 5 we are given a definitive answer on where this relationship is going. This season, as usual was filled with the classic lines that it's famous for and below are some of my favourites.From Episode 4: Guardian Angels:House: \"I can't ask the black guy or one of the chicks to do it; it'd be insensitive.\"From Episode 10: It's A Wonderful Life:House: \"You talk to your kid about sex so she'll think you're open about everything. Keeps her from asking questions about the things you don't wanna talk about.\"From Episode 13: No More Mr. Nice Guy:House: \"Run him for everything you can think of: lepto, schisto, hemo and the fourth Marx Brother nobody ever heard of. \"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I Still Love This Show", "unixReviewTime": 1218672000, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2008"},

This season decided to sidestep a little and really take some time to highlight the supporting characters. The moments of the series that give me the most consistent pleasure are the moments with Laurie interacting with Robert Sean Leonard and Lisa Edelstein. Those scenes are attacked with gusto and a great deal of humor. The \"medical mysteries\" are slightly more edgy than your usual doctor drama, but don't really add to what makes the show great as often as they could. I will close this review by saying that the season finale is one of the most tragic episodes of television ever.

Instead of superheros with superpowers dressing up in tights to save the world, Heroes features a bunch of ordinary citizens who have superpowers - and face the consequences. These characters each have unique powers and each copes with the powers in his or her unique way. The show had a lot of potential for character development and moral allegory.I think the show partly succeeds in the former. Some of the characters become quite interesting and unique. However, unfortunately, too many of the characters are too milquetoast. It's as if in not wanting to make the characters comic book superheroes the show makes them boring. I think this was the wrong direction. Too many of these characters would have been interchangeable with your average soap opera character with little difference, except for the flying, electricity, etc.Where the show really disappointed me is the story. There was a lot of potential, but the writers chose to go with the usual tropes of 1) a secret corporate conspiracy, and 2) a psychopathic villain. I for one am sick of these. In recent years it seems like most sci-fi shows have adopted one or both of these tropes. Few of the episodes provide particularly thoughtful plots. I didn't ever find myself thinking that the show raised a particularly interesting or novel moral issue. Too bad.Season 2 actually was better in some ways than Season 1. I loved Hiro's \"hero's quest.\" Hiro is one of the few characters I've come to care about. He provides a wonderful mix of humor and thoughtfulness. Kristen Bell's psychotic Elle was also a nice addition. She's one of the few characters who has the potential to develop into a larger, more interesting personality.However, Season 2 suffers from a lack of focus. There's no ticking bomb or the equivalent. Sylar is still around, hitchhiking and the like, but he's not the main threat. I like the idea of a slower season, but this season just went slow nowhere. Even worse, Sylar is just getting annoying. He's lost his powers, but the other characters still can't seem to kill him. This is partly because they are incredibly dumb. Several characters see Sylar distracted, and then proceed to announce their presence and warn Sylar of the risk. Note to superheroes: when you're facing an incredibly dangerous super being, stealth is good. Sneak up on him and shoot. Don't give him a chance to shoot first. A few too many moments like this one for Sylar and the other villains just reduce the respect viewers have for the heroes.Overall, I'd give it 3 stars.

I mean the strike was useless, not the writers themselves. It left us with nothing but crappy reality shows through-out most of the year. Heroes season 2 told as good of a story as it could've due to the short time. It does start out a bit better than it ends though. Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka) still steals the show. Him in the past where he meets his childhood hero Takezo Kensei (an excellent David Anders of Alias) led to some of the more engaging stuff of the season. Parkman (Greg Grunberg) finding out that his father is infact Molly's nightmareman was a little disappointing I admit. However the nightmare scenes were done well enough that I didn't care after awhile. I just wish that their was more of him since he was one of the fresher things about this season. He also was a little creepy.Speaking of creepy, Sylar (Zachary Quinto) is back but powerless. He shows that he's dangerous even without his powers though. He meets a woman with a dangerous power that kills everyone around her when her eyes turn black and bleed. She's a good person but her powers kill people and only her brother's power can control her power if that makes sense. Sylar gets in her head and makes her think that he's a good person that wants to help her. When he's really just fascinated by her power and wants it for himself. Well when he gets his back that is and he thinks Mohinder (Sendhil Ramamurthy) can help him get them back.While Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) mysteriously lost his memory and doesn't remember his brother Nathan or even having powers. He falls for a women who's brother says he can help him remmember. He wants him to use his powers for bad though before he'll help him. While Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman) moves his daughter Claire (Hayden Panettiere) somewhere to protect her from the company. He tells her to stay low. That's easier said than done when a kid there sees that she has powers. It's ok with him though since he can...fly.I was entertained by the season. It has many twists and turns. Does it all lead up to something great though in the end ? No, I can't really say that. Instead of NY being threatened by a bomb it's now threatened by a virus. While instead of Hiro seeing the future and seeing that NY is doomed, Peter does instead. So they could've been more original, it was too familiar to what we already seen in season 1. While Ali Larter has shown she can act as Nikki, she's wasted in this season with little to do.It also bugged me that some new heroes have powers that we have already seen. Such as, one can fly \"like Nathan\", while another can heal \"like Claire\". However those were probably my only problems with the season.

Since it doesn't have to introduce the characters, premise, or plot, the creative team could tell a straight-ahead story that never stops accelerating right up through its final moments.  But as the \"alternate ending\" demonstrates, they drew up short just as they hit a new creative flowering.Last season's survivors struggle to gather their lives and move forward--no small task when you've saved the world but can't take the credit.  Scattered from Japan to Ireland and from the present to the medieval past, they orbit each other, struggling to unknot the conspiracy that binds them together.  But when old secrets come back to the fore, the heroes must face a new enemy: their own collective guilt.If I had to find fault with this season, it's the needless introduction of new characters who complicate the narrative arc.  This season has so many characters that some of them disappear for two or three episodes, and we sometimes don't notice.  Like the X-Men comics of the 1990s, when Xavier's mansion housed a strange, expanding army, it becomes difficult for the audience to keep all the angles in mind.But for all that, it remains a tightly structured and propulsive story.  It makes good use of popular science fictional standards in a new and inventive way, and it plays interesting characters with complex needs off each other faster than the speed of light.

I rounded it up from the three and a half that it deserves.A host of fans and ex-fans and critics have thoroughly thrashed HEROES so far this season.  I doubt if this episode and the incredibly disappointing use of Kristen Bell will turn things around.  The reason the show has gone south is easy to locate:  the writing is simply below par.  This comes out in a host of ways.  Let me enumerate just a few.First, after a fun Season One in which we were all waiting for the various heroes to come together, they were all immediately dispersed in the first episode of Season Two.  Structurally, everything that happened in Season One screamed for some unification of the characters.  But nothing like this occurred.  Instead, the series feels like it has been restarted.  Not good.Second, instead of focusing on the already large cast of characters, they decided to introduce a large number of new characters.  I think the fury of many fans against the Central American sister and brother making their way north is more than anything anger that time is being spent on characters other than those already established.  And while I really like Dana Davis and think she is the cutest thing this side of sliced toast, her power seems too similar to Peter's.  Anything she sees others do, she can do as well.  Anyone with a power, Peter can acquire by being in close proximity.Third, the stories simply aren't very interesting so far.  It is possible that the foundation for an interesting story later on is being laid, but not much so far has actually been very compelling.The introduction of Kristen Bell is a prime example of what has gone wrong with the show.  I've avoided spoilers so I wasn't sure what her power was going to be (though had I seen the teaser that Amazon's Unbox uses to introduce it I might have).  They reveal her power almost immediately and in such a mundane way!  Wasted opportunity guys!  It should have been teased out a bit.  And after she finds out where Peter Petrelli is she is called away from Ireland to another part of the world.  Why?  The only interesting thing about her debut was the revelation that she works for her father.  But here again I'm afraid that HEROES is going to disappoint.  Usually when we get info like that in a well written show we imagine that we don't know who the father is, only to learn later that we do.  My fear is that we haven't met her father but that he will be an entirely new character.I enjoyed HEROES in Season One, but I always thought it was somewhat overrated by many fans.  I was astonished that anyone considered this better than LOST, let alone vastly superior shows like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  And PUSHING DAISIES can be added to that list.  But this year so far at least 15 or 20 shows have been better.  I gave Season One a five-star review and I do feel that it deserved it.  But overall so far I would give Season Two a three.  But I tend to be an optimist.  I both hope and believe it will get better.One last word.  I wonder what the departure of Bryan Fuller as Consulting Producer has meant for the show.  He wrote what was far and away the best episode of HEROES so far, the absolutely splendid (and Emmy nominated) \"Company Man.\"  I don't know how much he brought to the show.  But I do know this:  so far HEROES has been a disappointment, while Bryan Fuller's new show PUSHING DAISIES has debuted with three absolutely astonishing episodes.

On the one hand, Coach Taylor was off at Texas Methodist University, making his ongoing involvement in the narrative a challenge.  On the other hand, there was the unnecessarily melodramatic killing by Landry of Tyra Collette's Season One stalker/attempted rapist.  The latter has been a problem because what made Season One so outstanding was how it felt like an encapsulation of real lives.  The killing simply didn't feel real.In my opinion the show always managed to overcome these missteps to remain a fascinating and engrossing show.  But it did generate the sense that the season in some ways hadn't really begun.  In this episode, however, Coach Taylor is back in Dillon, back in his old job, and returned to his family.  And his return already seems to have helped several individuals.  His wife Tami already seems less stressed.  His daughter, who had been sorely tempted by the older bad boy known as The Swede, seems to have recovered her relationship with her mother, who gave her advice that may have helped Julie realize just how lame The Swede truly was.  And he seems to have helped Buddy Garrity just as much.  In the first three episodes Buddy seemed unsure of himself, rattled by the loss of his family as well as his status within the booster club.  Here he is as confident as ever.The delicious part about this episode, as with the series as a whole, was the sheer number of things that took place in it.  The show in many ways breaks with much traditional TV writing.  A typical episode will have an A plot and a B plot, though after HILL STREET BLUES in the early eighties, many shows would have multiple threads in an episode.  But some episodes of FNL have 7 or 8 or 9 threads going at once.  Yet, it doesn't come across as at all incoherent or muddled.  I'd love to see how they organize their various arcs.  I assume they have some sort of ongoing storyboard.After being a major part of the first three episodes, the Tyra-Landry romance/murder ordeal played a somewhat smaller role in terms of time.  Tyra does come to Landry's house for dinner, a nice touch.  Though she has been increasingly attached to Landry, she has been somewhat unwilling to make their relationship obvious in public, let alone to her or his family.  So this represents a big step, especially combined with her explanation in the previous episode to Landry's father why she likes Landry (a great scene because it was almost as if verbalizing to someone THAT and WHY she liked Landry caused her to realize just how much she had come to feel for him).  While at dinner, however, Landry and Tyra overhear what they had been anticipating:  the discovery of her assailant's body.  I have no inside knowledge of what is going to happen on the show, but I think it is pretty clear that Landry is going to confess to what he did.So, despite a couple of things that seems atypical for this remarkable show, FNL seems entirely back on track.  These remain a collection of many of the best characters on television and the acting in this show can stand comparison with any other show.  I'm still not too excited about it being scheduled on Friday, but it remains, along with PUSHING DAISIES (easily the best new show of the season) the one show I most look forward to each week.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Now Season Two can actually begin", "unixReviewTime": 1193443200, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2007"},

The effects of such a shake-up can be seen in two crucial ways during the course of this season: 1. The pacing of the early episodes; & 2. The abrupt ending when there should have been more episodes to round out the plotlines.Coming off an incredibly strong first season, this second installment of \"Friday Night Lights\" is, at least at first, markedly different from the original slate of episodes.  There is less of a focus on football and much more on just character drama in general.  For a few examples...the effect on the Taylor family of Eric's TMU job, the strange blossoming of the Landry/Tyra relationship, the struggles of Matt Ceracen, and the tumultuous Jason/Lyla/Tim triangle of friendship/love/stupidity.In fact, for the first six or so episodes of the season, very little football is seen whatsoever.  Unfortunately, this was caused by the \"wait and see\" approach because of the writers strike and thus the subplots became paramount while the show creators were biding their time.  While the show is still okay in this format, it lacks that \"football punch\" that gave it such heart in the first season.As the second season winds down, though, the episodes really start to pick up in all areas.  The somewhat cheesy and overly dramatic plotlines of the early season (Jason to Mexico, a murderer body, etc.) fade into the background and that nice football/life mix takes center stage once again.  In fact, just when you'll think things are truly back on track...the season abruptly ends in mid-stride (again, the strike).  The first episode of Season Three will go on to fill in the gaps, but that is most certainly not the prescribed way to run a dramatic series such as this one.Overall, then, while I cannot give this season a full five starts due to behind-the-scenes issues and a straying from the powerful football scenes, it is still a solid effort that succeeds in pushing storylines forward and creating some great ensemble drama.

Is it true that this season wasn't as consistently strong as the stellarSeason Twoand the classicSeason Three, but there is no way that this deserves such a low rating by anyone's standards.  While the beginning was a bit of a letdown, it is still overall a strong and hilarious season.POSITIVES+ Despite what the other reviewers said, it still feels like \"The Office.\"  Whatever faults the early episodes have--and they do have faults--are gone by the second half of the season.  The second half is filled with episodes as funny and touching as anything that has come prior.+ The character arcs were handled nicely.  I loved Pam/Jim, of course, and I loved the emotional roller coaster than was Michael/Jan.  A lot of great stuff goes on between all the characters actually--even Andy.+ Risks are taken a-plenty.  Two main characters have left the branch.  One of them has left the cast altogether, and the other has moved up to a position of power.  By the end of the season, a worker will outwardly defy Michael, a cast member will go to jail, and another worker will leave the office for good.+ This collection also comes with a script (\"Dinner Party\"), which was a wonderful surprise.  I'm a screen writer, so checking out this script was an essential and revealing look into the mechanics of the show.NEGATIVES- The first few episodes feel quite off, and I think these are probably the main reasons people rate the season low.  Both Michael and Dwight act even more outrageously than usual in this episode, and the plotline with Dwight and Angela's cat was really pushing the limits of believability.  Also, the first four episodes were hour long ones, so the dynamic of the show--short, punchy episodes--felt a bit off for a while.- The comedy seemed more slapstick than before, what with the car going into the lake, the mushroom incident, and the Meredith being hit by a car thing.- I'm as big a Pam/Jim fan as there is.  They are the couple I am very much rooting for; but I felt that Karen was sort of tossed aside without enough plot focusing around it.  It made Jim, as a character, seem sort of cold.  I loved their interaction when they finally crossed paths, but it did seem a bit too little, too late.BEST OF THE BEST1. The Deposition: Michael's best \"that's what she said\" jokes yet, along with some really heartbreaking stuff2. Goodbye, Toby: \"The Office\" has never been able to match Season Two's \"Casino Night\" when it comes to season finales, but this comes close.3. Branch Wars: Jim gets sucked into Michael and Dwight's antics, which leads to an awkward moment with an ex.4. Dinner Party: Michael's home life explodes5. Did I Stutter?: Ironically enough, I came to respect Michael as a boss in this episode.OVERALLGood season.  Not the best of the series by any means, but still a very entertaining comedy.

There are some spoilers in this review.In the spring of 2007 it was reported that NBC had asked the producers of THE OFFICE to expand it permanently to a one-hour format.  Initially I thought this was a terrible idea, that the show would be irreparably weakened by expanding it to an hour.  Then I saw the Season Three DVDs with the deleted scenes and with so many really great deleted scenes, I though that perhaps it would be possible to expand it to an hour.  Now, however, I'm not so sure.  Especially after this last of the four one-hour episodes that start off Season Four.  As a half hour show, THE OFFICE almost always leaves you wanting more.  But as a one-hour show, it always seems to go on too long.  Like most of the four episodes starting off this season, this one just felt like it was over before it was over.I'm not saying that it would never be a good idea to have an hour-long episode.  The show has had some very good expanded episodes in the past.  But four in a row seems to have stretched the show further than it really wanted to go.  I'm actually looking forward to it going back to shorter episodes next week.This episode revolves largely around two major stories.  First, Michael's increasing money woes created by having Jan live with him without working any herself.  To help make a bit more money he takes a second fulltime job as a telemarketer.  The scenes showing him at his second job are the weakest in the episode and really do feel like padding to make the show go a full hour.  The other major story centers around Pam and Jim deciding to visit Dwight's bed and breakfast.  After three years of teaming together to play tricks on Dwight -- and indeed this visit starts off as a trick on Dwight -- they realize how deeply he is hurting because of his break up with Angela (caused by his killing her elderly but deeply beloved cat by putting him in her freezer) and make a couple of gestures to try and make him feel better.  For instance, they give his utterly dreadful B&B; a stellar review on the Internet.  I like the symmetry of Pam and Jim not being together for a long period of time during much of which Dwight and Angela had a hidden relationship.  And now that Jim and Pam are together, Angela and Dwight have broken up.I have no doubt that the show will get back on track, but to do so, the network needs to permanently commit to the show being only a half hour each week.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "One of the weakest episodes yet of one of my favorite shows", "unixReviewTime": 1192838400, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2007"},

Big changes at Dunder-Miffin as Jan loses her job, Michael interviews for it but,ultimately, it goes to Ryan who started as the office temp. Jim and Pam finally move forward in their relationship while Dwight and Angela fall apart when Dwight sticks her old cat in the freezer. Andy is there to pick up the pieces leaving Dwight moping about in a Charlie Brown shuffle. We see the aftermath of all these changes from season three in four. Let's hope Michael's clueless management style doesn't change in season five as it is pivotal to the humor of the show (and it reflects reality--I can't tell you how many Michael Scott's I've worked for in 20 years).The writing is still pretty strong for the fourth season but what's truly missing during season four is the Michael-Dwight dynamic as Jim becomes Michael's #2 and Andy picks apart the bones of Dwight's relationship.Picture quality is extremely good throughout the set.The extras include commentary tracks (although none by Steve Carrell or John Krasinski)but we do get plenty of deleted scenes cut together in the same order as the episodes...almost making an alternate episode for each one. It's a good set even though it's shorter (14 episodes but we do get four double episodes which really makes this almost like 18 episodes)and does go down a few strange roads (Michael, Dwight and Jim looking like poster boys for any game featuring Mario and Luigi as they punk another branch).

Michael Scott keeps doing his hilarious thing, but what sets The Office apart from all other comedy sitcoms is its ability to keep developing the characters and maintaining its quality level (e.g. not turning into a soap opera).  This season did not provide a drop off in that category as Jim & Pam \"shippers\" will be delighted at the return of that complicated romance, as well as the tension that always exists between Dwight and Angela.Thus, despite its shortened stature, I considered Season Four to be better (quality-wise) than the one preceding it.

Finally a sitcom that was original, refreshing, and, most of all, hilarious. When Season 2 began, my expectations were high. To say that my expectations were surpassed would be an understatement of grand proportions.Whereas the plotlines and randomly vanishing characters (any one of Rachel Dratch's appearances???) in Season 1 were out of left-field in that funny-but-almost-too-random kind of way, Season 2 was a different kind of animal.\"30 Rock\" season 2 came from left-field, but this time, it pulled you over there with it. In the beginning, it held onto some of the pitfalls of Season 1 (i.e., Where was Jenna half the time???), but as episodes aired, the ensemble and the writing both grew into something much greater and more entertaining than Season 1 ever reached.Even as many shows suffocated and failed the hiatus the writer's strike brought, \"30 Rock\" seemed immune. In fact, I would be so bold as to suggest the break fueled the creativity. Either those last handful of episodes were pure, unadulterated brilliance, or I was just desperate for more \"30 Rock\" after their lengthy sabbatical.Some brilliant moments in Season 2: Carrie Fisher as a crazy ex-writer, EVERYTHING involving the Devon (Will Arnett) vs. Jack rivalry (including the Don Geiss coma), Jack's job at Homeland Security (can you say, \"gay bomb\"?), & Kenneth's House Party AND a special appearance by Al Gore satiring himself (\"A whale is in trouble!\") in one episode?

As the Amazon description reports, the A plot focuses on Jack's effort to outposition Devon Banks (marvelously portrayed by Will Arnett in a reprise of his Season One guest appearance) to become Don Geiss's replacement at GE, the parent company to NBC Universal.  The struggle is quite funny.  Devon, who is a lightly closeted gay, has \"turned straight\" and is courting Geiss's daughter.  He is also using the fact of Jack's heart attack, which he has attempted to keep quiet, to lessen his position within the corporation.  In response, Jack merely recruits a young, very handsome dude who tempts Devon beyond his powers to resist.  All in all, it is gamesmanship on a very funny level.The B plot is quite as good.  Jenna is still very overweight from all her pizza consumption during her involvement in a stage version of MYSTIC PIZZA during the summer break.

For me, the biggest improvement was a move away from having Liz (Tina Fey) fixed up with a man each week; instead, she has a few brief flings, notably with two exes from Season 1 - lawyer Floyd (Jason Sudeikis) and low-brow Dennis (Dean Winter).  The show aso did a nice job of giving less screen time to some of the less funny characters, particular Pete the producer (Scott Adsit) and Judah (Judah Friedlander).A number of funny plot arcs were developed over the season.  Jenna (Jane Krakowski) gains weight because of her role in the musical version of \"Mystic Pizza,\" which apparently involved eating a lot of said pizza.  At first, she's desperate to lose the weight, contacting Dr. Spaceman and discussing drastic measures; however, she ends up embracing the weight when it makes her popular on the show and gives her a new catchphrase - \"Me want food!\"  Jack (Alec Baldwin) spends much of the season sucking up to Don Geiss (Rip Torn), the CEO of GE who is in the process of naming a successor.

Plus, the international arms dealer that everybody was after has disappeared, and the CIA wants to know where he's at. Finally Tony makes an entrance, and we gather that he had to blow his own cover with Jeanne, and tell her that he's an NCIS agent, and that he's after her father. And then magically, we get to the end of the episode. Jenny has all of a sudden turned into a rule breaker, step outside of the law type of character. We know she killed La grenoulle, and there is only one episode after this one. Where Tony has a hard time getting over Jeanne, since he actually fell in love with her. And then we don't get anything else for the rest of the season, as a matter of fact. I would have thought, that after going undercover, then being forced to reveal to your target's daughter that you're a federal agent, and that you really love her. I would have thought that have made him a bit more mature, but nooooo. Instead we get one episode, then it's back to the freshman in college Dinozzo.

It felt more like a soap opera, the only episode of any real worth was \"Chimera\" where they go on board a deserted Naval research ship, out in the middle of the ocean. And even that episode is so-so, Jimmy Palmer has an entire episode where a killer is after him, and even after going back and watching that episode a couple of times, I still don't understand why that script got off the ground. And we come to the ending of the season, I'll just say it, Jenny dies in a shoot-out out in the middle of the desert. And to be quite honest, you really don't care by the time they get to it.

Ever since \"Bete Noire\" in Season 1, this series has always used it's season finale to essentially set up the next season's finale.  \"Bete Noire\" introduced Ari Haswari.  In the finale to Season 1, Jethro Gibbs shot Ari to cover Haswari's double agent status--though Gibbs would have preferred to kill Ari.  Because Ari wasn't killed at the end of Season 1, he was able to murder Kate Todd at the end of Season 2.  Because Ari shot Kate at the end of Season 2--and more importantly, WHY he chose to murder her--we were able to get the backstory of Gibbs revealed, the tragedy surrounding his first wife and daughter, which culminated with Jethro leaving the MTAC at the end of Season 3.  Because of Gibbs' \"retirement\", NCIS Director Jenny Shepard was able to initiate her off-the-books operation against Rene Benoit, using Tony DiNozzo to romance La Grenouille's daughter Jeanne.So as we get into Season 5, we have the culmination of Shepard's attempt to avenge her father's death by killing Benoit, though she crosses both the CIA and the FBI in the attempt.  \"Bury Your Dead\"--especially its final scene--sets the tone for the season.  Though the show has its usual action, interplay between its characters, and bawdiness that has made the show such a wonderful view, there also seems a certain weight to the season.  The regular viewer knows the story with The Frog isn't over, moreover there has to be a deeper reason why Shepard seemed willing to pursue Benoit without government sanction.  It is the playing out of this season that, again while the season has its usual fun, seems to give the season a somewhat sad tone.Still, the performances are at their usual high standards.  Mark Harmon's Gibbs is his usual self, though we are once again shown more of Jethro's past and his genuine heart.  While Michael Weatherly's Tony DiNozzo is his usual obnoxious self, the aftermath of the La Grenouille affair leaves our boy shaken, both because of his feelings for Jeanne and being used by Shepard.  Tony's conscience comes in the form of Ziva David; who, while enjoying her usual verbal sparring with DiNozzo, also makes Tony own up to his feelings about what happened and what it may have done to Jeanne.  Cote De Pablo's Ziva, with her hair straightened and deemphasizing her widow's peak, becomes a more Americanized woman (and the shots of Cote bending over ain't too bad, either). We didn't have an episode that featured Sean Murray's Tim McGee a season after The Probie's year with his nom de plume (Thom E. Gemcity), but Pauley Perrette's wonderful Abby Sciutto gets her usual fun, especially in \"Dog Tags\".  David McCallum's Ducky Mallard is most representative of the tone of the season, because he becomes privy to the secret that Jenny hides through the season.This leads to Lauren Holly, and the end of the Jenny Shepard storyline.  Shepard seems calmer this season, especially after the disappearance of The Frog (Even propositioning Gibbs in \"Lost And Found\"), but we figure something had to have been motivating Jenny attempting something that would compromise the agency.  That something plays out through the season, and is revealed in  \"Judgement Day\", the two-part season finale, which of course sets the table for Season 6.The high points of this season are \"Ex-File\", in which a part of Jethro's past becomes a part of an investigation (Plus, we get a visit from Susana Thompson's Hollis Mann--this episode is capped by a wonderfully sad sequence at the end), \"Internal Affairs\" (The body of La Grenouille resurfaces, and we meet Rocky Carroll's Leon Vance--Carroll draws greatly from Daniel Benzali's character in \"The Agency\" from earlier this decade), \"About Face\" (Where Brian Dietzen's Jimmy Palmer is featured, and reveals a slight obsession with footwear), \"Judgement Day\" (Which brings Gibbs and Shepard's long-ago Paris operation--the one where they also became lovers--to a full circle, as well as Jethro coming to a sad conclusion about the murder of The Frog), and the simply magnificent \"Requiem\", in which Gibbs, while aiding the now-grown best friend of his late daughter, is finally able to put to rest the loss of Shannon and Kelly.Performances of note are Joe Spano--we don't see as much of Tobias Fornell as we usually do during a season.  Susana Thompson, whose character retired from the Army when she realized Jethro hadn't recovered from losing his wife and daughter (Why do I suspect that Holly will appear again--in Hawaii, living on the grounds of a novelist, and driving a Ferrari?).  Susan Kelichi Watson's Nikki Jardine, the NCIS Intelligence Analyst who happens to be a germophobe (Leading to many moments where the team exploits Jardine's phobia for their humor), and Muse Watson returning as Mike Franks in the season finale, with his usual cowboy demeanor.  But Cameron Goodman's performance in \"Requiem\"--as Maddie Tyler, Kelly Gibbs' best friend as a child--gives the episode the impetus that sets Jethro toward finally making his peace with losing Shannon and Kelly.NCIS has always been a fun show, with an ability to wrench at the heart in unexpected moments.  This is a season that has an underlying tone of sadness and impending tragedy, and it gives the season some unusual depth.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "NCIS Season 5--Beneath The Surface...", "unixReviewTime": 1227571200, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2008"},

This is a fantastic season, despite the depature of Jorja Fox (Sara). Surprisingly, there was hardly any fanfare when she left (not on screen anyway). Her relationship with Grisolm was only beginning to take off for the viewers and before it could really get off the ground, she was gone.In the first episode, Dead Doll, the team race against the clock to find Sara who has been left for dead in the heat of the desert. That was one of the best episodes. My next favourite episode was A La Carte where they investigate a beheaded teen from a go-cart accident. Then in Cockroaches and Lying Down With Dogs, we start to see Warrick in a whole different light - drugs and alcohol and he's framed for a murder in these two episodes. The final show for this season is called For Gedda in which Warrick is accused of murdering a famous Vegas gangster and even he is uncertain of his guilt or innocence. What happens at the end of this episode will leave every fan in shock (even though you've probably read about it or seen it already). I was devastated.This season gives us a real good look into more of the characters personal lives. The story lines always remain fresh and there seems to be no shortage of material and ideas for keeping us fans loyal. It remains my absolute favourite show and as usual, I cannot wait for it's release. I only hope that for a change, they'll put a synopsis on the dvd cover of each episode.

After Lily played by Alyson Hannigan and Marshall played by Jason Segal got married at the end of season 2, they start looking for their own apartment to live in and think about the future. Marshall tries to find just the right job and is finally exposed to the mountain of Lily's debt that he has been saddled with. Ted played by Josh Radnor and Robin played by Cobie Smulders are no longer dating and things are tense between them all season. Barney played by Neil Patrick Harris continues to be AWESOME, but starts to develop feelings for Robin.This season was the season of guest stars! Starting with Enrique Iglesias (\"Would you dance....if I asked you to dance...\") as a boyfriend Robin picks up while on vacation, James Van Der Beek as Robin's ex she never got over, Heidi Klum playing herself, Sarah Chalke of \"Scrubs\" playing Stella who is Ted's new major love interest of the season, and Britney Spears plays Abby who is a receptionist in love with Ted and manipulated by Barney. Ted is occasionally a horrible person in this season and his behavior often contradicts his lofty goals and morality of past seasons.Bonus Features:The \"Series Retrospective\" is a great sum-up of the first two seasons narrated by Bob Saget as older Ted. Lily & Marshall's Honeymoon videos are pretty cute and home video authentic which makes me wonder if they were originally supposed to incorporated into some episodes, but they made a great extra. The \"Cast Favorites\" Featurette is where each cast member tells what their favorite episode is and why.Behind the Scenes of \"We're Not From Here\" Featurette is just like the last two seasons where they kind of show the process of getting from the read-through, to rehearsal, to run-through, to rolling for the episode. For the additional scenes: How It Really Happened just shows the extended and deleted scenes from episodes.The \"You Just Got Slapped\" music video is just Marshall behind a piano being very serious and does not feature NPH. The \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" music video is just as awesome as \"Let's Go To The Mall\". The Gag Reel once again does not disappoint and includes a random makeout session between Marshall, Lily, and Barney and the actual words yelled during Lily and Marshall's fight that had been dubbed over in a previous episode and features more music from The Solids. The \"Ted Mosby is a Jerk\" Audio Track is playing during \"The Bracket\" episode because Barney once posed as Ted Mosby to sleep with a girl and confronts her and she made a website called TedMosbyisaJerk.com. It's a weird slow song playing with girls being mad at Ted while subtitles of the show dialogue appear in black.There is commentary on \"The Platinum Rule\", \"Ten Sessions\", \"The Bracket\", \"The Chain of Screaming\", \"Sandcastles in the Sand\", \"Everything Must Go\", and \"Miracles\" and they split up individual actors again and also have Sarah Chalke with Josh Radnor for \"Ten Sessions.\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "HF reviews How I Met Your Mother Season 3", "unixReviewTime": 1296345600, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2011"},

First, it is abbreviated, to only 15 episodes, filled out to 19 with four added from Season 4. Second, it is a transitional season, where Zach Addy, one of my favorite characters, is written out of the series with a MOST, MOST improbable conclusion to episode 15 and Dr. Lance Sweets joins the cast as a guest character in this season. I was not entirely keen on two of the main story arcs of the season, the return of Temperance Brennan's family, especially her father, played by Ryan O'Neal and the Gormagon narrative. Two other arcs, Sweets' book on Booth and Brennan and Angela's search for her Brazilian husband are pretty good, as they help introduce Sweets, and make the Angela / Jack romance more interesting than just constant dalliances here there and everywhere.The first two episodes from Season 4, which take place in London, seem to breath fresh air into the series, and promise good things.

{"reviewerID": "A1KE3JBO3KQX2O", "asin": "B000WFFAIA", "reviewerName": "Brian C.", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "I recently watched seasons 3 through 6 of Bones on Netflix and I decided I would review each season, but I want to preface each of my reviews with three comments. First, I want to give my SPOILER ALERT. I do not shy away from giving away what happens in each season so DO NOT read my reviews if you have not already watched ALL of the seasons (I sometimes give away things in later seasons in reviews for earlier seasons as well, so be careful if you have not watched all the way through season 6).Second, despite the tone of my reviews I really enjoy the show. I do not watch much television, but I have watched all of Bones, and I would not have watched all of it if I did not find it enjoyable. That having been said, my reviews are going to mostly be complaints. I am (I am afraid) one of those human beings who decides to take to the internet to air their grievances on a public forum, because they think their opinions are really more important than they really are. So these reviews are mostly grievances despite the fact that I really like the show. I just find it is easier to talk about what I do not like, rather than what I do like.Third, these reviews are not really written for people who are new to the show, or have not watched the seasons. In fact, these reviews are probably not written for anyone other than myself. But if anyone else should get any enjoyment from them, I would not be upset. I am actually curious to know whether other people share some of my complaints, so if you do (or you don't) and you feel like posting a comment under my review please feel free to do so. Okay, now to the review.I will actually begin with something that I really enjoyed from Season 3, and that is the Gormogon story arc. Bones is essentially a formula show. Each episode there is a murder. They all start out the same way, with some unsuspecting person happening across a dead body. The show then sets up three or four suspects, before finally settling on one. But the show does not usually have an overarching, season long, mystery to solve. I enjoy it when a show sets up a season long mystery (like in Dexter) that only gets solved at the end of the season, and I actually wish Bones did more of that. Gormogon is really only the focus of a few episodes from the season (if I am remembering correctly) and there are always individual murders to solve each episode, but it is nice to have the Gormogon mystery hovering in the background throughout most of the season.I was not, however, entirely satisfied with how the Gormogon mystery was resolved (this is where my SPOILER ALERT is in effect). The notion that Zack Addy was an accomplice to the Gormogon I actually thought was a good idea. I like it when shows surprise, and I like it when a show lets the audience know that the main characters are not off limits, and that anything can happen. One way of doing that is by having a character who everyone has become familiar with, and perhaps even grown to love, turn out to be the accomplice of a murdering cannibal.The problem I have is that shows rarely have the courage to trust their audience. If you are going to have a main character turn out to be the accomplice of a cannibal, it would be better to go as dark as possible with it. But shows always tend to pull back at the last minute. First, they pull back by having Zack blow up his own hands in order to protect one of his workmates. I am not saying they should have had Zack kill one of the other main characters, but they clearly set that up in order to downplay Zack's \"evilness\" (for lack of a better term). I think if you are going to go for it, you need to go all the way, otherwise you do not really make anyone happy. You upset the people who do not like to see the main characters messed with at all, and you upset the people who enjoy that kind of thing by not having the courage to go all the way with it. You cannot do something like that half-way. It would have, in my opinion, been great to find out that a character you had been watching for three seasons was genuinely evil, rather than simply misguided by logic. It could have potentially raised some continuity issues, but I think those could have been dealt with by simply saying that he was hiding his true identity.And that brings me to my second complaint with the resolution. One of the recurring themes of the show is the debate between logic (or science) and emotion (or faith). Or the debate between the head and heart if you prefer. The show never really succeeds, in my opinion, in dealing with this theme in a very deep way, which, admittedly, I think is too much to expect from a television show. Part of the problem, in my opinion, is that they caricature each position. There is very little subtlety. The representatives of the \"logic\" camp (Brennan and Zach) are all logic, and the representatives of the emotion camp (Booth and Angela) are all emotion. The solution to why Zack fell in with the Gormogon is that he let himself be deceived by logic, and this is supposed to represent the dangers of pure logic. That is an interesting idea (although, personally, I think the world tends to suffer from too little logic, and not too much) but to be executed correctly it needs to be more subtle, and more logical. There is nothing very logical about Zack's decision to fall in with the Gormogon. Brennan, when she finds out, attempts to reconstruct the syllogism behind Zack's decision, but it is not a very strong logical argument at all, and certainly not an argument that would convince anyone with even average intelligence, let alone someone of Zack's supposed intelligence. The notion that Zack would choose to murder people based on such a poor logical argument is highly implausible, and was clearly an attempt to partially absolve Zack from the crimes by removing any actual evil intent.In this season it is also discovered that Zack is responsible for stabbing the last victim of the Gormogon to death. But in the next season (another SPOILER) the show again pulls back by revealing that Zack did not really stab anyone, and he only confessed to the murder because he revealed where the victim lived to the Gormogon (who apparently was incapable of discovering that for himself?) and felt responsible for the man's death. In other words, the show takes the step of making the killer one of the main characters, but then does everything it possibly can to pull back from that decision. In my opinion, you should either go for it or not. Either you make the main character a killer, in which case, you go the whole nine yards, and make him evil as well, or you find another killer. This, to me, is a recurring pattern that you see in television shows. Apparently writers and producers do not trust that the audience will go along with them, or they think people will be too upset, or too shocked. And maybe they are right. I imagine they have done more research on the subject than I have. But still, speaking from my own personal perspective, I would like to see a show go all the way with it sometime, and not pull back at the last minute.Now, I have one more complaint with the third season, but before I launch into that, I think I should say something positive about this season. I was not sure when Dr. Lance Sweets (played by John Francis Daley) was introduced into the show, but it says on Wikipedia that it was in the third season, and I think he was an excellent addition to the cast. I think part of the reason I like him is because I was a big fan of Freaks and Geeks (although it took me at least a season before I realized it was the same actor since he is not a kid anymore), but I also enjoy the character, and his interactions with Booth and Brennan. So if Wikipedia is right, and this was the season that Sweets was introduced, then that is a definite plus for this season in my book.The last thing I want to mention, or complain about rather, is the episode where Booth is shot, and the succeeding episode. There is not really any big spoiler here, since obviously the show goes on, and Booth remains a central character, I knew that Booth could not really have died, but the episode where he is shot ends without knowing for sure if he lived. The next episode, to my surprise, begins with his funeral. I will save the reader the details of how the show finds its way out of this mess (of course Booth is not really dead) but let's just say it was a pretty ridiculous solution that made no sense. If they wanted to leave the viewer in suspense for the first five minutes of the episode after Booth was shot they could have found a better way. I realize that shows have to stretch realism to a certain degree, and I am willing to suspend my disbelief up to a point, but there are limits. The solution, in this case, is totally implausible and makes no sense.So that is my opinion. And now I am sending it out into the world, and pretending like there are other people out there who are actually interested...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "One person's opinion...", "unixReviewTime": 1337558400, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2012"},

Two excellent seasons under its belt, and a truncated Season 3 (damn you, writers' strike!) finally all wrapped up, and predictably, these are good episodes, as well. But only fifteen of them! As Season 3's first episode (\"The Widow's Son in the Windshield\") opens up, we learn that Bones has been reluctant to go in the field with Booth and she won't say why. However, a head flung off a bridge forces her to reconnect with Booth. This episode also begins a new serial killer arc, this one being particularly even more gristly and diabolical than most, and of which resolution later down the season would have tragic consequences.Season 3 doles out several other subplots. As per the startling news learned at the altar from Season 2's finale, Angela is already married. An ongoing story arc becomes Hodgins and Angela's search for her long-time but vaguely remembered husband. \"The Secret of the Soil\" introduces Dr. Sweets, a 22 year old psychotherapist assigned to counsel Bones and Booth, this stemming from the FBI's concern due to Booth having arrested Bones' father. These sessions are generally funny stuff as, mostly, Booth can't help but treat Sweets like a kid. Plus, these scenes tend to open things up even more between Bones and Booth.I've a couple of Season 3 favorites. \"The Widow's Son in the Windshield\" introduces the cannibalistic Gormogon killer, which would become a key ongoing story arc of the season. \"Mummy in the Maze\" is a very neat Halloween show, wherein Booth's shameful phobia is unveiled and Bones's costume is...simply awesome. \"The Knight on the Grid\" is a taut thriller as the Gormagon killer returns, this time with a personal vendetta against Bones and Booth. And \"The Santa in the Slush\" is a standout sentimental episode and provides one of the best moments in the series as Bones cuts a deal to have Christmas brought to her incarcerated father and brother. Cool ending, too. \"The Baby in the Bough\" has Bones forced to babysit an infant involved with a case (you see the potential, right?). Meanwhile, \"The Wannabe in the Weeds\" (in which Zach and Bones both sing) and \"The Pain in the Heart\" are striking for their ability to stun the audience, even if the latter episode definitely had a rushed feeling to it. I feel that the after-effects of \"The Wannabe in the Weeds\" should've been developed further in \"The Pain in the Heart.\" In fact, \"The Pain in the Heart\" - which wraps up the Gormogon killer storyline and, by the way, will upset busloads of fans - could've really, really benefited by being a two-episode arc.The cases are still bizarre and the corpses borderline grotesque. But the draw remains Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz, and that electric \"thing\" between them. These two still get aces in chemistry, and are still the smokingest hot couple on television. Emily Deschanel continues to nail her role of Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan. And while her character might've loosened up a little bit (not too much), there's still that endearing naivette and vulnerability which peek out occasionally. And, of course, her refreshing bluntness (some call it social awkwardness) has never left. Boreanaz, he's just a great leading man. Confident and charming, bristling with machismo, yet with a sensitive side. His unveiling of his Christmas present to Bones in \"The Santa in the Slush\" is one of the best, most touching scenes of the season.Tack on the rest of the offbeat but familiar crew from the Jeffersonian Institution, and these folks continue to provide the best show in forensics crime-solving. All the ingredients to the series' success are on display for Season 3 - the boosts of levity, the whiffs of romance, the chilling mysteries, and the ongoing character developments.

And it is these closures that have to be examined.The first one is the integration of the psychiatrist and profiler Dr. Lance Sweets. He officially comes to help Dr Brennan and Special Agent Booth deal with the stress in their relationship due to the extreme tension their work is bringing in and imposing onto them. He is some kind of relation counselor. At first they took it badly but little by little they accepted to consult him and to follow his advice. That brings some clarification in the warped relationship that develops between the two people concerned. Little by little too he is integrated as a profiler in some of their cases and even later in all of them. This is a new development for the series.The second closure is really a closure. It concerns Temperance's father and by ricochet her brother. He is finally brought to court for his killing of the FBI deputy head. Dr Brennan is not even called as a witness whereas all her laboratory friends and Special Agent Booth are. She stands with the defense and she holds her position well. The tactics of the defense is simple. Let the prosecution put down all their cards and then let's deal with the jury's most intimate conviction. In other words let's give the jury some alternative hypotheses as who could have done the killing. Here Dr Brennan plays an essential role to save her father and set him free. Can such a flawless scientist accept to be doubted and even negatively represented even if it is to save her father's freedom?The third closure is Zack. He had been sent to Iraq at the beginning of the season but his absence had not held one full episode. He was brought back to Washington DC because of his disruptive role in a military team due to his inability to integrate. But his attitude and role is becoming overbearing with everyone. Some would say that he must be slightly autistic and that would be a mistake. He is a very fragile personality who compensates his weakness in character with over-competence in his scientific field. He is irreplaceable. Yet he can become the prey of any strong personality he would encounter. His enhanced scientific competence is over-normal but it is a way to hide his brittleness. This season will bring Zack to his doom but you will have to be discovered it by yourself.The fourth closure is also contained in this season. It starts at the beginning of it and ends with its final episode. It is the story of a serial killer that appears in some episodes. This serial killer is obviously imitated from Dexter and his viciousness is even worse than anything you may examine. Of course he tries to penetrate and infiltrate the Jeffersonian Institute and he will succeed for a time, though his agent will not be the best he could have found. He is a cannibal, the heir and continuator of an old practice against secret societies. We can hear there an echo to some of Dan Brown's cogitation about old secret societies and free masons. That serial killer will be destroyed and will finally exit the series under a nickname, Gormogon. He is nameless.This last element is surprising in such a series because the series is hyper scientific and tries to reject and even rebut all superstitions, mythologies, beliefs and even religions. Dr Brennan should know that the unnamable, the one who does not have a name, the one whose name is unutterable us also the one who was, the one who is and the one who will come. To keep a criminal nameless is to deify or at least magnify that criminal just as if he were some kind of divinity.That's the last remark I will make on this third season. It deals with social cases more often than criminal cases, and the crimes in each case are the result of weak people who cannot cope with the stress of life. Gormogon is the exception. In one word the series gets better as for its thrilling, even frightening atmosphere and it analyses in fair and fine details the relations between the various members of the team, of the laboratory, of the people who have dedicated their lives to fighting against crime.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "More unnamable than I you die", "unixReviewTime": 1295395200, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2011"},

The series is BONES and there is no better way to watch this than on DVD. Why? Because once you get into the series you'll want to continue on rather than wait for the next episode.Just released is BONES SEASON THREE: TOTALLY DECOMPOSED EDITION. How can it be that this show has been on that long already? For those unfamiliar with the show its time to catch up.Based on the real life of forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs, the story revolves around Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel), a forensic specialist who works at the Jeffersonian in Washington, D.C. When the FBI comes calling for assistance in the form of Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), Temperance takes to field work like a pro with an intense interest in each case presented.Along with Temperance, known as Bones to Booth, are a team of equally dedicated professionals at the Institute. Among them are Angela (Michaela Conlin) who specializes in facial and body reconstruction via sketches and computer software, Dr. Jack Hodgins (TJ Thynes) who specializes in organic materials and Dr. Zack Addy (Eric Milligan) who knows more about bones than, well, Bones. Each member of the team adds to a complete whole not only in their expertise but in their character functions as well.For the first two seasons we were allowed to explore the world of the \"squints\", Booth's nickname for the intelligent research team at the Institute. But as the show continued, we watched as Booth came to appreciate each individual in their own way. We also watched the sexual tension between Booth and Bones grow in the most subtle of ways as they worked case after case together.There you have it, the main crux of the series. But it's more than that. It involves cases being solved using clues found only by this team of forensic anthropologists. Each week they discover clues no mere mortal would find with the naked eye. And each week Booth and Bones have the chance to put the guilty behind bars. At the same time we get to watch the interplay between the characters as well.What you have here is a combination of age old detective show combined with the technological side shown in the various CSI series. But rather than focus mainly on the science of evidence we get that as well as interaction between characters in more familiar TV territory. Romance and buddy systems are seen in each episode as opposed to straight police work.This brings us to season three. This time around we begin with Bones acting unlike herself. Could it be because Booth sent her father to prison at the end of last season? Could it be the attraction between Bones and Booth became too much? Or could it be because Zack had decided to take a leave and head out to work in Iraq?  Just as the stories offer clues to the murders, the series offers clues and at times answers to these questions.As the season starts we find Hodgins and Angela still very much in love, still planning on marrying and still searching for the man who was a one night stand Angela married in a drunken stupor. This was an arc left open from season two that finds an answer this year.Zack returns from Iraq a bit different. Fortunately for fans of the series (and Zack) he shows up in the first episode, just in time to save the day and help find the criminal.Bones and Booth start off not nearly as close as before. Whichever of the reasons discussed that seem to have had an effect on Bones is clearly visible from the first minutes of episode one. And as the pair start to work things out, they begin therapy to help with their work.The first show offers a new challenge for viewers and the team as they encounter a secret cannibalistic society that has left their calling card. While the Gormogon killer may not be a familiar name to most, it will be by the end of this season. Not only are the guilty not found by shows end but they continue to show up during the season.A more in depth view of Bones sex life is offered as well (no, not seen) as we begin to meet the men she dates. This seems to upset Booth who does his best to hide it. The affection between these two characters may be more blatant than Scully and Mulder of X FILES but it is still held in check for the present.Humor, mystery, relationships and friendship are all regular topics in each episode of the series. And Season Three brings forth more of the human characteristics of each member of the forensic family found here. It is these human qualities and interaction between characters that makes this show the success that it is. While Bones comes off as cold and out of touch with the world around her, Seely comes off as having lived more than his years would seem.

Whether that's because I relate to Brennan's social awkwardness or not is another story.  But it is just so interesting and well written (usually) that it completely engulfs you and is the perfect tv show to make a marathon out of.  Which is what I did this weekend with Season Three.For those not familiar with the Bones series (and if you aren't go check out the first season, it kind of describes all the characters for you), Dr. Temperance Brennan is a forensic anthropologist that works with FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth solving murders.  She's brought in for skeletal remains and helps with clues that most people would miss.  Supported by a team at the Jeffersonian where she normally works, she has the greatest resources and best friends for handling the job.Characters:Emily Deschanel: Temperance BrennanDavid Boreanaz: Seeley BoothMichaela Conlin: Angela MontenegroEric Millegan: Zack AddyT.J. Thyne: Jack HodginsTamara Taylor: Camille SaroyanJohn Francis Daley: Lance SweetsBrennan and Booth are definitely the main characters of this show.  It's because their chemistry on the set that everything works as well as it does.  By playing off of each other, both poking fun at their weaknesses and admiring their strengths, their relationship feels very real.  Adding in Dr. Sweets to evaluate it doesn't help much (at least in my opinion) but it does give the viewer a chance to see more of their personal interactions. Angela, Hodgins, Camille and Zack all don't really have as big of a part in this particular season though.  At least not until the end episode.  They kind of fade away into the background and I think Brennan's family gets more screentime than they do in a lot of episodes.  I really enjoy watching the rest of the group so that was a bit of a disappointment for me.And then there's the overall plot of this one.  Most of the episodes are one-offs and can be watched somewhat out of order because they don't tie into the main story arc.  But there are a couple things that do, like Angela and Hodgins relationship, Brennan's family troubles, and then the bad guy \"Gormogon\" who is a cannibal and is mentioned in a lot of the episodes.  They were all interesting arcs, but since we are dealing with a short season due to the writer's strike, everything seemed rushed and some of it just didn't tie in.  I was especially disappointed in the way they took Zack's character as it completely didn't fit with his personality and seemed implausible.  For them to veer his part in the plot so far off was obviously a casualty of the strike.Obviously because of the graphic nature of some of the crimes and police scenes in this series, it isn't for people who are squeamish.  And while there's no overt scenes, sex is hinted at as is nudity.  Although in my personal opinion the scene with Booth in the tub is worth at least a star for this series.  I do enjoy the special effects.  Everything looks very realistic and even the Angelator machine, which I know isn't real, seems plausible.  Although it isn't used a whole lot in this season.  The music is always pretty great in the series too.  They seem to use little heard of artists and one of the songs from the first season is still a regular on my playlist.  They're just good at picking that kind of stuff out to fit the show.I can't say that this was my favorite of the seasons.  It offered some disappointments but it's still better than a lot of shows that are out there.  And I still definitely like the main characters enough to keep watching.Review by M.

During the fourth we had a number of marvelous episodes but the story arc involving the cannibal serial killer Gormogon dominated most of the season.Two excellent episodes are expanded on this set with an unaired version of \"Player Under Pressure\" and the Holiday episode \"The Santa in the Slush\" has an \"extended kiss\" scene. While the latter isn't any big deal the former for \"Player Under Pressure\" improves an already exceptional episode.We also get the gag reel which is fun, a featurette \"Director's Take\" (which I haven't gotten around to watching yet--I tend to watch all the extras AFTER I've watched the episodes to prevent spoilers). While the extras aren't quite as generous as previous seasons, at least Fox isn't recycling the same idea (i.e., commentary tracks--although I like them--a lot of folks never listen to them and they are dependent on how engaging the people involved with them are). The episodes from season four while we'll get them again, are a nice way to fill out the set and keep fans in anticipation for the next set which will come out about the same time next year.All in all an excellent season that was unfortunately cut short by the Writer's Strike.

{"reviewerID": "A1V8ZE9BH0WTXE", "asin": "B000WHIIO6", "reviewerName": "cinephiliagal", "helpful": [20, 27], "reviewText": "First off, I've enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades, and they've all had some things in common, and they've all had some differences. Most of them steal from the original (Bram Stoker) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources (such as Anne Rice) because vampire canon, such as it is, was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re-invented imaginatively by Anne Rice. I loved, loved, LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the TV show, not the movie) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show, as was its spin-off Angel.That said, I disagree with most reviewers who've said Moonlight is a rip-off of Buffy or Angel. It is not. The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires, not the pantheon of assorted trolls, demons, and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated. Also, the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans -- and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight, the short-lived (3 seasons) CBS \"Crime Time After Prime Time\" early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto. Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight, in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the \"monster\" he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built-in emotional tension for character and relationship development, plot devices, and historical flashbacks/backstory. Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman, with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger, death, or some other terrible outcome (the human being \"turned\" vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath); thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other's lives (plot device), and only half-heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same, er, species (living or undead) (also plot devices). And, like Nick Knight, Mick St. John prefers not to drink (eat) humans -- but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood, Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood. Moonlight, in those respects, is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight. (After this point, there are SPOILERS, so you may want to stop reading now...)However, there are some clever differences: Forever Knight's big, bad sire vampire LaCroix, who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his \"gift\" of eternal life (and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor/protege possessor/possessed relationship) has been replaced by Coraline. Coraline is Mick St. John's ex-wife and sire on Moonlight -- an apparently evil female vampire who'd lived some 500 years, sired Mick (made him a vampire) on their wedding night (in 1952), and enmeshed him in an obsessive, addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually couldn't. He never wanted to be a vampire -- he didn't even know she was one when they married. She made him a vampire against his will, without asking him or getting his permission. Now, of course, he has \"trust issues.\" She, from her perspective, gave him a \"gift\" of eternal life -- freedom from death (sounds familiar -- like LaCroix on Forever Knight!).Coraline crossed a fatal line, however, when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little \"family\" (sounds familiar, eh? rather like Lestat, Louis, and Claudia in Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire). Mick, by this time (1982), was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective (it is implied, though not directly stated, that he \"does good\" as a PI because he feels guilty about the \"bad\" he's done as a vampire). It was in this capacity that the girl's mother approached him to find her daughter Beth -- only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re-invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes don't kill vampires, they just paralyze them. Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe. Mick, in his PI role in the first episode, finds the distraught mother's little girl, rescues her, stakes his crazy ex-wife/lover/sire Coraline to paralyze her, and sets the place on fire before locking her in. The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family. Thus begins Mick's distant \"relationship\" with Beth Turner, who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire, a mostly online magazine that's not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox's character Lucy edits on FX's show Dirt, except it's less celebrity-focused and more local crime story sensationalism. Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight, \"No Such Thing as Vampires,\" Beth, now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions (but news-whore tendencies), winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers. Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA (with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef, a 400-some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring, formerly on Veronica Mars).I didn't watch this episode on CBS. In fact, I didn't watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all -- I watched them on CBS' web site of full video, Innertube. I was intrigued by Alex O'Loughlin's eye-candy good looks, I've always loved the vampire genre, and I dearly loved Jason Dohring's dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars, so I knew I wanted to catch the show. But I wasn't about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing. The first episode was as predicted: stilted dialogue, cliche-ish plot devices, utterly predictable plot and twists.However, what keeps me watching the show are several things: (1) the show has a beautiful, SoCal corrupt clarity about it, a noir look that is dark, decadent, sexy, and shiny; (2) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he's on it because he's got screen presence and, despite the poor material, seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills, including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language, which communicate volumes; (3) Jason Dohring, who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen, and plays his amoral, jaded vampire role to the hilt, practically eating up the scenery, and (4) Sophia Myles, who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight (in the first Underworld movie) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion, and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin. She also isn't your typical stick-thin, anorexic-looking TV actress; the girl's got a little meat on her bones. So, unlike many of the women on TV, she actually occasionally looks like a \"real\" woman. Finally, (5) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it's set in -- LA -- and the surface-obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode, however, was straight out of B-movie (or is that B-TV) hell. I thought, \"Eh, that was was pretty; I'll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better.\" I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O'Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back, too. But I wasn't expecting much from the show based on the first episode. I figured it would be my guilty pleasure, something I'd watch as \"webisodes\" and not much else.Surprisingly, it's getting really good. This has a lot to do with improved writing, developing backstory, intersecting relationship triangles, and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick's ex-wife and vampire sire Coraline. It's still eye candy, but I don't feel as guilty about watching it -- and now I actually watch it on TV. I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox. I credit mostly Alex O'Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this. But the most recent episodes (we're up to episode 9 now) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick, while also increasing the tension between Mick's happily-amoral and happily-non-human friend Josef (Jason Dohring) and the unhappy, secretly self-hating Mick, who longs for a cure for his vampirism, some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick \"went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster\" has only improved the show's \"grab\" factor. The chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn, but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon. And there's a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well. There are some very sexy (though still network-TV-permissible) scenes on later eps and I'm looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake: like Angel, Buffy -- and Forever Knight before them, as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night -- what makes Moonlight, and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires. It's that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human, and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two (or three or four) evils, or when emotion overrules reason in our decision-making. They're still vampire shows, and that will result in some people dismissing them outright -- just as some people dismiss science fiction as not \"serious\" literature. But as Battlestar Galactica fans know, it's not the genre that defines the shows, it's the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they're thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective, this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all, and neither is the second. But the show is coming along, it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode, \"No Such Thing As Vampires,\" and the second Moonlight episode, as the contrived set-ups they are for the seven following (more entertaining and less contrived) episodes.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "predictable, cliche-ish eye-candy that gets better in later eps", "unixReviewTime": 1195776000, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2007"},

But there's predators out there that need to be dealt with.\"It's a quirky reversal of Anne Rice tradition, and it sets the tone for a very unique blend of vampire tale and urban mystery -- and sadly it ended too soon. Especially since Alex O'Loughlin is an absolutely inspired vampire detective, and the quick direction, good CGI and snappy writing save this from being another cheesy vampire story.Mick St. John (O'Laughlin) is a vampire detective in L.A. -- where there has recently been a vampiresque murder of a college student. But though the student was obsessed with vampires, Mick soon realizes that she wasn't murdered by one. And with the assistance of Beth Turner (Sophia Myles) -- who insists he looks familiar -- Mick uncovers a weird little vampire-obsessed cabal at Hearst college, and a professor whose infatuation with undeath goes beyond mere fanaticism.And there are plenty of other nasty cases -- an ex-con gunning for the vampire detective, a forced stay in the desert, \"Black Crystal,\" a feral newbie vampire, a hooker-killing teenage vampire, a supposedly-dead cult killer, a killer gang going after Beth's boyfriend, a Hollywood starlet, an attempt to kill Mick's mentor, and a vampire who threatens to \"out\" every single vampire in L.A.But no vampire story is complete without the nasty pasts and romantic tension -- Beth discovers Mick's true nature, and finds herself drawn to him until she's hit by a terrible personal tragedy. And Mick is confronted by a woman who looks suspiciously like Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) -- his dead ex-wife, and the woman who made him a vampire.Most vampire stories, whether on TV or in movies, are so abysmally cheesy that you could slice them up and serve them with wine and crackers. Fortunately \"Moonlight\" succeeds in being quite a bit better -- not a lot of vampiric superpowers (beyond enhanced senses and healing), fangs and glowing eyes. The writers even poke fun at some of the old cliches (\"Garlic... is good on pizza\").The weakest part of \"Moonlight\" is the crimes themselves -- most are fairly ordinary murder mysteries. But the series does succeed in balancing out the vampire stuff with the private eye plots, and as the series winds on and becomes far more complex, the vampiric element becomes more essential to every story. Quick swooping camerawork, fast-moving plots, some nice nasty action.And these vampires are done with tongue in cheek, whether it's their un-cliche living conditions (sleek minimalist apartments and mansions) or their easy use of modern technology (\"If I hadn't become a vampire I would have missed out on the Internet, TIVO, World of Warcraft and GPS\").That slightly offbeat style is helped by the dialogue (\"Can you fly?\" \"Just like Superman.\" \" Really?\" \"No.... it would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?\"). For the record, the best lines are all from Josef (\"Well, the blood lust can be pretty heavy when you're first turned. And you could really lose it. I know I did. Damn, those were good times!\").Alex O'Loughlin is excellent as a vampire PI haunted by his past and his vampiric nature (\"monsters don't get happily ever after\"), but handling it with a wry sense of humor, brains, and enhanced senses. He even goes through some ups-and-downs that most fictional vampires don't, such as temporarily becoming sort-of-human, but fortunately O'Laughlin keeps him from becoming emo.Myles is pretty decent as the pretty reporter who begins to wonder if a human and a vampire can find love, and Sossamon is brilliant as the mysterious Coraline. And Jason Dohring absolutely steals the show as the witty, happily amoral Josef (\"She's delicious. '82 was a good year\"), who nevertheless has his own sad past.\"Moonlight\" manages to avoid the cheeze factor, and this all-too-brief series succeeds in being a unique blend of vampire love story and murder mystery.

Compared to the series, you do not miss much here when it is this or DVD. You have some extras but they are not that much or that often, and they are normally interviews and nothing more.

In the pilot there is a \"vsaampire killing\" case Mick looks into, and this is something that Mick finds dangerous. Apparently vampires have their way of living and concealing, and they do not like attention. This rleationshiip continues on through the show, and this and another one will come to define it.As far as a show on the supernatural, i liked it. It had a lot and it even allowed people to do things that a lot of shows seem to miss out on. The efffects, while not amazing, are great, and the acting was a lot better than anything I expected. Honestly, i thought the show might scream timber and fall a few episodes in but it kept the season going and it answers a lot. We get to know Mick, vamps, some humans, an a weird experiment that is going on.Its worth watching.As with all shows, there are filler episodes as well.

Unfortunately I'm at a bad point in my project.  I've already seen almost all of the shows that I've had reason to believe are better than average shows.  I'm now left with the dregs.Now, STARGATE ATLANTIS is hardly a \"dreg\" show.  I watched the first three seasons as they were coming out, until I became disenchanted with the series, in particular with the increasingly reliance on standalone episodes and on poor character development (i.e., lack of character development).  I was also concerned about the show because of the elimination from the show of Paul McGillion, who played Dr. Carson Beckett, one of the more interesting characters on the show.  Also, Tori Higginson, who had played head of the Atlantis Project Dr. Elizabeth Weir for three years, was planned to depart the show.  Despite the addition of Jewel Staite, who I had loved on FIREFLY, I suddenly found myself uninterested in watching the show any longer.I'm delighted to learn that not only was Season Four not a decline in the quality of STARGATE ATLANTIS, it was actually the most interesting season of the first four of the show.  Part of the reason was the replacement of Tori Higginson with Amanda Tapping, who reprised her role from SG-1 of Samantha Carter, sadly available with the ending of that show.  I never disliked Higginson, but I never felt that she brought much gravitas to her character (she also bore a disconcerting similarity to an ex-girlfriend of mind, which I personally found oddly distracting).  But the main reasons I found myself enjoying Season Four more than the previous seasons were a significant abandonment of the standalone format and the interesting inclusion of a wraith (Todd) as a recurring character.  In fact, apart from the third episode of the season, most of the first 13 or 14 episodes of the season were tied to the main overall arc.  Only in the final third of the season did a number of standalone episodes creep back into the mix.  The overall result was a dramatic improvement in the quality of the show's narrative.  Christopher Heyerdahl had played a variety of wraith characters in the first two seasons of ATLANTIS.  Then in Season Three came one of the best episodes in the entire series, in which Shepperd is imprisoned with a wraith (whom the Atlanteans later name Todd), who to keep from starving gradually drains Shepperd of life.  The two cooperate in escaping from their prison and over the course of the final two seasons Todd would provide an interesting character, often making an odd colleague in advancing causes that were in the interests of both humans and wraiths.  In one alternative future, Todd and Ronon even die a heroic death together, teaming up to kill their common enemy.  I've always had a love for characters that defy surface expectations.  On BUFFY I loved Angelus for being the completely evil doppelganger of the incredibly good Angel, and then later the utterly evil Spike gradually transforming (even before he gains a soul) an increasingly decent character.  Almost always Todd's presence in an episode means a good episode.Also in Season Four there was an increase in the quality of the special effects.  I'm not terribly conversant on CGI, but I do know that at about the same time the special effects on just about all CGI-heavy shows dramatically improved, led by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  I'm assuming that there may only be one CGI software package catering to customers at this level.  I imagine that the small handful of F/X companies all get the latest upgrade at about the same time.  In the 1990s there was a very small market for CGI and you could tell from the way that it was used on TV that it was very pricey.  Because much of it was custom, there was a dramatic difference from the way that it was used on one show and on another.  There are still differences.  Although they are certainly using the same software programs, on STARGATE ATLANTIS the CGI shots are very clear and crisp, featuring panoramic shots fairly distance from the objects of interest.  On BATTLESTAR GALACTICA you get very complex shots.  In Season Four of BSG, for instance, you might get a super close up of the Galactica, with a large hunk of the fleet in the background, the whole shot not centered from an ideal observer's point of view, but from what you would see if you were in a spaceship very close to Galactica.  In ATLANTIS the visual field is uncluttered, with no cosmic dust or anything else to impair perfect clarity of picture.  On BSG there are often vast clouds of cosmic dust that causes a complex diffusion of light from a nearby nebula.  Both shows feature photo realistic CGI, but the uncluttered clarity of ATLANTIS shows a different set of priorities with the more complex version of BSG (and for the record, I much prefer the CGI on BSG, which I believe represents the highest achievement so far of what can be achieved with CGI on TV).All in all, I really enjoyed Season Four.  I am only now getting around to watching Season Five (the DVDs come out later this month, but friends showed me some sites that stream the individual episodes) so I don't know how it will compare with Season Four, but I definitely prefer Season Four more than any of the first three.  I now definitely regret that I stopped watching ATLANTIS.  Now that I'm watching many shows that I have little confidence in to be any good (I just recently managed to grit my way through ANDROMEDA and fairly soon need to force myself to watch all of LEXX, concerning which I still haven't heard anything to make me at all optimistic), discovering how good ATLANTIS was in the season after I gave up on it has been a very pleasant surprise.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My favorite of the first four seasons of ATLANTIS", "unixReviewTime": 1245715200, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2009"},

Be it work related, child related or simply not having time related, it's nice to be able to get a whole season and watch episodes back to back. Like this week's release, MY NAME IS EARL SEASON THREE.For those of you who have yet to watch EARL, Jason Lee (star of numerous Kevin Smith movies) stars as Earl Hickey, a bumbling goofball whose life has consisted mostly of low end scams, thefts and mischief in general. Earl's life changes when he scratches off a winning lottery ticket...only to watch it fly away after being hit by a car.While recuperating, Earl has an epiphany. Karma had worked its magic on him, causing him to lose the ticket in return for all of the bad things he's done in his life. While lying there, Earl writes up a list of all the people he has done wrong with the intention of correcting his mistakes. As he sets out to do so, the ticket finds its way back to him.Each episode of EARL features Earl and his bumbling idiot-though-lovable brother Randy (Ethan Suplee) trying to track down one of the people on his list and making up for whatever Earl did to them in the past. Season three starts off with Early not being able to do so since he made a big correction at the end of season two.Earl took the rap for his ex-wife Joy (Jaimee Pressley) and is now in prison. Fortunately for Earl, a number of the people he made mistakes with can be found there as well. And in helping them, he finds himself owing favors to others in prison, including the warden (Craig T. Nelson).As Earl tries to do right, Joy feels guilty so takes Earl's brother in with her. Talk about a conflict of interests. Joy is self centered, cheated on Earl with crab cook Darnell \"Crabman\" Turner (Eddie Steeples) to whom she is now married and is the biggest stereotype of trailer trash foul mouthed gorgeous redneck that you will find on film. Randy on the other hand is about as simple minded as you can get without having brain damage. The two together are like oil and water.The first half of the season is spent in prison with Randy dealing with the loss of his brother that evolves into Randy becoming a guard at the prison (after scoring a 55 on the tests, the highest score ever). Joy deals with being the surrogate mother to her half sister's baby, requiring her not to have labor induced or have any pain meds during birth. And Earl? Earl does his best to pay back Karma.Want an example of the comedy involved here? It's difficult to choose from one of the many scenes that are side splittingly funny. But how about the one where Randy at the Fourth of July fair finds his head covered in cotton candy. It appears that he got so involved watching the guy make it that he got dizzy and fell into the cotton candy machine resulting in his head being covered in enough cotton candy that he can't see. Okay I know, it loses something in the translation but trust me, it is funny as all get out when you see it.The guests in episodes help make this show one of the funniest on TV. But it is the core players who make it worth watching week after week...or in this case disc after disc. Jason Lee is a treasure, performing as the smart alek with attitude who isn't near as smart as he thinks he is. But in the end, Earl always sees the bright side of things and offers a touch of wisdom that makes the episode a morality fable.Pressley as Joy is hilarious. Her mouthy attitude, strong willed character and ability to see that the world actually DOES revolve around her (at least in this trailer park) are a joy to behold. And Suplee as Randy does an incredible feat in making a bumbler not only appealing as a sympathetic character, he makes it easy to laugh when he messes up as well.The rest of the casts are just as acceptable but it is these three that stand out. Season three made me laugh out loud more than once and on more than one occasion, I found myself having to pause the disc because I was laughing so hard. If you are in need of a laugh, you can't do much better than this show.

Jensen Ackles really got a chance to show what a great actor he is.  The season begins after Dean sells his soul to save Sam and has less than a year to live.  Ackles shows the broad range of emotions that one would feel knowing that they will de soon, along with terror and denial he feels about spending eternity in hell.  I thought that the show wouldn't have anywhere to go after Dean killed the yellow eyed deamon who killed their mother and Sams girlfriend in the S2 finale, ending the storyline that had driven the show for the 1st 2 seasons.  What we got with season 3 was a revitalized show that was alternated between stories that were heartbreaking , ones that kept you on the edge of your seat, and ones that made you laugh so hard you ended up crying anyway.  The best episodes of the season have got to be Mystery Spot, and Ghostfacers.  In Mystery Spot the Jokster Demon from season 2 returns and tourtures Sam by making him relive the same day over and over until Dean dies a horrific death at the end and the day rewides.  You will laugh out loud at the creative ways the writers kill Dean over and over and see a new side of Sam when he loses his brother and realizes that he is alone for the 1st time in his life.  Ghostfacers was a very different episode that brought back the bumbling ghost hunters from season 1.  Thay had decided to create their own show and collide with Dean and Sam on a hunt.  The entire episode is shot with handheld cameras (a spoof of Ghost Hunters on SciFi) and actually has a great storyline included.  If you have never watched the show before, you are missing out.

The whole season is going to turn around the dilemma for Sam and for Dean. Sam will resist the idea of Dean's death and will do all he can to save him, including by dealing his own death instead, but Dean is willing to die since he-they has-have given everything to this war against the Monster, the yellow eyed demon that killed their mother, and that they supposedly killed at the end of the second season, and this war has brought them nothing as for life, enjoying life, etc. Better dying than just surviving on nothing at all, or even a dry bone. For Sam the only problem is that Dean's death means he will be alone to go on with this fight and that frightens him though we see him operating a couple of times alone and he can manage properly.We could think then the season would be rather dull. But there you are wrong and the next season is being prepared very carefully.First it is fun to fight demons. So we have a Christmas special this year, and a real Christmas special it is with reminiscences from the past when the two little boys were alone for Christmas when their father was hunting. And neither of them both forgot to get a present, no matter how little, for the other since anyway Dean did not believe in Father Christmas and Sam was told it was all a fake, a scam, a tall tale. But the Christmas party they enjoy now with two nice little Celtic survivors who decide to have some fun for this Christmas and enjoy a good old cannibalistic feast gives quite some enlightening for to the celebration. We can wonder if the mention of the pagan and Christian sides of Christmas, and this including Christmas in the show mean something or at least are there for a reason; other than simply a Christmas special because it was broadcast one week or two before Christmas, though the series being in real time, there is no reason why Christmas should not be present, especially since it shows how the two brothers when younger and forlorn, some could say neglected if not abandoned by their father, looked after each other including with Christmas presents that were valueless in themselves though emotionally of great value for the two boys.Second it is Reality Show TV time really and fully and they have to have their own reality show and they do with some real blood and flesh dummies who want to visit and track if not trap the ghost who is haunting the Morton House. One of the dummies will die in the adventure, the intern of course which does not count much, not one of the brains of the caper, and they will not be able to put the money in their bank though because Sam and Dean have manipulated their computers with a big magnet that erased all the programs, reformatted the hard disk in a jiffy.Third let's think of the poor children that are chased away from the TV and this series because of the gross nature of these horrible monsters. So let's have one full episode on fairy tales. Unluckily it is a girl in a coma who should have been unplugged from the survival equipment a long time ago by her own father, the doctor, who is reenacting in real life the fairy tales her father is telling her in her coma. The versions of Snow White and the Little Red Riding Hood are amazing and the way Sam and Dean manage to save the poor Little Red Riding Hood from the Big Bad Wolf is heroic and absolutely entertaining for very young children who will be able to learn that they must not go alone to the woods nor get in the cars of strangers.But the war against evil is serious and has little to do with a fairy tale. So let's go back to work, boys.This year is built on the presence of two women. Bela, who could be Bella of course, is a girl whose specialty is to steal ancient objects in order to sell them for a profit. She steals anything the boys, particularly Dean, may have in their pockets. A mummified hand for example, an enchanted rabbit's foot or the famous colt that can kill the Demon with one bullet. But that is too much, far too much and that will lead to the ferocious end of Dean being taken to hell by the Hounds of Hell and will end up, like in Hellraiser and Hellbound, two fairy tales told in many chapters and volumes by Saint Clive Barker, stretched out at the tip end of hooks tied up to chains that are going to dismember him forever and ever, each body part growing back after having been ripped off, I guess. A delicious ending for a monster hunter.A second woman, Ruby, who is a demon possessing a woman, is going to haunt the two boys because she wants to help and Sam is ready if not keen to listen and accept. But Dean and Sam refuse bluntly when she suggests to Sam to learn how to use his psychic power that can defeat Lilith, the demon who is after Dean's life. So he can't in the final confrontation with the girl who was possessed by Lilith and had caused a lot of damage, who has been able to get a whole gang of demons in the neighbors all around, so that the boys are trapped when they finally come into the house where the girl is living. And at the very last minute when Sam is going to kill her he is stopped by Dean who is able to feel demons since he is minutes away from Hell. Lilith in fact is in the body of Ruby who is possessed twice and since the boys do not have the special colt they can't kill the spirit Lilith in Ruby. The spirit keeps them at bay till midnight when the Hounds of Hell are introduced to get Dean away. She is so powerful she can keep Sam at bay against the wall but at the last minute the spirit Lilith goes away leaving Dean in Hell, Sam beaten up against the wall and Ruby with no good sense left in her. End of the season. Let's wait for the next one to revive the good Dean.But there is even more in this season that prepares the next season. They get rid of Gordon, the black hunter and some of his acolytes, all of them black except one. They have decided that psychic people like Sam have to be executed straight away and they have already executed a few. But Gordon will end up a vampire and Sam will behead him with a good old thick cable just as if it were a butter wire cutting up a block of soft butter. Altogether at least four Sam-hunters are eliminated, three of them black. If that is not a bias or maybe a prejudice, what is it then? Once again with these Sam-hunters or hunters of psychic people we have a case of their nave feeling they are doing a good thing when they are only doing what seems to them the only right they can do, though they are trying to destroy the only person who can save them, save humanity.At the same time another black character is redeemed, Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is possessed. He arrests the two boys on a lead given to him by Bela who is escaping with the Colt. But a whole gang of spirits arrive and start killing people around the police station. The demon in Victor makes him shoot the Sheriff but he is kind of forcefully taken under control by the boys who had managed to get a crucifix and had made some water holy. And the boys exorcise the demon out of him. It is then Victor is redeemed and they organize the siege and the trap that will kill all the demons inside as soon as they are trapped using an infernal contraption: the intercom of the station that broadcasts the exorcising ritual formula. Brilliant. He let the two boys go, but they will learn later with Ruby on TV that the Demon Lilith, possessing a little blonde girl (evil can be everywhere and come in all forms) came herself afterward to get some vengeance and she destroyed the police station into ashes on the ground killing all those inside and close to it, including of course the redeemed FBI Special Agent. Isn't that sad? The two boys have it more and more difficult to save one person and when they do then the demon kills a dozen outsiders and innocent bystanders. But the redemption of Victor Henricksen, Special Agent by profession, is good news after all since that one was saved before being destroyed. His soul will go where it should and that is not in hell.The last remark I would like to make on this series is the great number of allusions to other classics in the field. The Shining by Stephen King is so often alluded too that I will not even specify. Come with me, Come with me, come with me, and you will know. Of course you also have Clive Barker at the end. But you have so many others like the Night of the Living Dead and in a way Michael Jackson's Thriller, If you do have some time and energy left when you have finished watching the next three seasons I would advise you to go back and identify them all. And that's where plagiarism is not what it used to be. Plagiarism used to make pale imitations of real stuff with tit bits stolen here and there, like Canada Dry instead of Whisky and ginger ale instead of real ale. We could of course think of the fake Frankenstein's monster who is the doctor himself and who has become immortal by substituting in his own body the parts that are getting old. Mad scientist, mad doctor, or whatever. There are so many of them running loose and free around in the street. Aren't you afraid of going out to smoke your cancer stick in the yard? I would be if I were you. You might be snatched by two moths from out space. Plagiarism you said? The pleasure is not plagiarized though.I will not insist on the debate between the two brothers and the love that becomes at times dense and impressive, but also at times pathetic and our empathy for the death of the elder brother is wearing out, especially since we know there are three more seasons to go and a fourth one running right now. But the car is also less present in this season. Sam has his own, by the way, and the Impala seems to have been reduced to a gadget in these episodes. It is present for sure, but certainly less than before. I hope it is not for long because I like the machine. The car seems to be less present since their future as a pair of hunters is compromised. They own the car together and it brings them together. The car being their only real possession, something they inherited from their father and that created a unity in their family, keeping them close and bringing them from one point to another together. On the trail leading to Dean's death, the car cannot keep them together or close, because one will surely die and the other is trying to save him by following new paths to save him, sometimes in ill-advised directions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A little bit of wind at the Crossroads of thise series", "unixReviewTime": 1322697600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2011"},

Now in its third season, Eric Kripke'sSupernaturalcontinues to show that it has mastered the balance of horror, humor, mythology, and drama that Angel was known for.

While the overall arc and even the episode-by-episode quality isn't as great as the fantastic second season, it remains a quality show packed with emotional highs, lows, and \"Holy ----, I can't believe they just did that!\" moments.  This season sets out to tie the previous seasons up nicely, giving deserving ends to many of the old arcs.  The Gordon storylin gets paid off, as does the \"Sam/Dean are wanted men\" arc.  The main story of the season, however, springs from the deal that Dean made in the finale ofthe second season.Dean, to bring Sam back from the death, made a deal that his soul will be taken to Hell in one year's time.  The bulk of the season, though it maintains a somewhat episodic feel, deals with that situation, throwing the two brothers into a fight against the one force they can't conquer again: Death.  Dean's impending death adds such a poignancy to the season, particularly the episodes stretching from the Christmas special to the finale, that even his possible resurrection in Season Four (it has to happen, people) wouldn't take away from the emotional resonance of this arc.Overall, it's a slight step down from the fantastic Season Two, but still a great season of a great show.

First, Dean has sold his soul to the Crossroads Demon to save Sam's life and has one year to live before the demon collects on the bargain.  Second, the Winchesters open up a Devil's Gate and release hundreds of demons into the world.  Season three runs at a breakneck pace, largely to Dean's impending doom.  His deal is referenced in nearly every episode and you get the sense of being on a trail speeding headlong into the unknown.Two new recurring characters are introduced in season three, both of them female.  First there is the demon Ruby (Cassidy) who becomes Sam's guardian angel (so to speak) looking after him for her own reasons.  Bela Talbot (Lauren Cohan), sometimes ally but usually foe, appears in six episodes.  Bela deals in stolen magical talismans and the like but is hiding her own dark secret.Season three is the darkest and grimmest season so far.  As time ticks away, the Winchesters become more desperate and careless to find a way to free Dean from his deal.  With hundreds of demons on the loose you might think that the season would become one-dimensional but that is not the case.  The writers did a good job of sprinkling in side stories into the writer's strike-shortened, 16-episode season.Among those shows that separated themselves from the main plotline were \"Bedtime Stories\" where a comatose girl brings the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales to life and the wonderfully amusing (and gory) \"A Very Supernatural Christmas\" in which the boys encounter a pair of Pagan Gods disguised as average suburbanites, who are feasting (literally) on their neighbors.Among the best episodes of the season (in addition to A Very Supernatural Christmas) are \"Jus in Bello\" as the Winchesters are captured by the FBI and are jailed in a small town Colorado jail until they can be moved.  The show is inspired by Fort Apache: The Bronx as dozens of demons converge upon the jail intent on killing everyone inside.  For the first time we hear about the demon's new leader, Lilith.In \"Fresh Blood\", the Winchester-hating Gordon, also a hunter, escapes from prison and begins hunting the boys down again but has a fatal encounter with a vampire, turning him into a creature of the night.People are receiving calls from the dead loved ones in \"Long Distance Call\".  While the people are overjoyed to hear from their deceased family members, the Winchesters do not believe whatever is calling them are benevolent spirits.The season and Dean's fate concludes with \"No Rest for the Wicked\" as the clock strikes midnight on the last night of Dean's deal.  While it was a solid season finale, it felt very rushed.  The last episode would have been better served as a two-hour finale but that probably was not possible due to the strike.One of the major developments of season three was Sam's development as a stronger character.  When Dean tells Sam that they have to kill Gordon before he kills them, he surprises Dean by agreeing.  Sam becomes more forceful and takes the lead on several occasions as Dean tries to prepare him for life as a solo hunter.  The only disappointment about season three is that Cassidy will not be back for season four as Ruby, as her contract was just for one season.  She is replaced in season four by Genevieve Cortese.While the five-disc set does not feature any audio commentaries like the first two seasons did, it does come with episode introductions by the various directors or writers.  Other extras include three featurettes on special effects, Dean's Impala, and the \"Ghostfacers episode\" along with a gag reel.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best Season yet!", "unixReviewTime": 1233014400, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2009"},

Sam devotes himself to try and find a way out for his brother from this binding deal and they find a new adversary--Lillith a major, nasy demon. They find Ruby (Katie Cassidy) a demon WHO is surprisingly on their side and instructs Sam (and a very reluctant Dean) in how to fight Lillith. The Winchester boys also must face off against Bela (Laruan Cohan)who often allies herself with them so she can extract her own pound of flesh--she's a dealer in supernatural curios and makes millions doing it. The third season also finds the boys facing the seven deadly sins incarnate, being pursued by their nemesis the hunter Gordon (Sterling K. Brown), being caught by the FBI (and facing an oncoming army of dark assassins working for Lilith), changlings that infiltrate a neighborhood, dealing with those goofy \"ghostchasers\" who shoot a pilot for their own TV series and also manage to stir a very nasty ghost in the process.The variation on \"Groundhog Day\" took an unusual twist midway through which improved the quality of that episode. It moves from comic to sobering and quite moving as Sam copes with Dean's fate and learns what caused them to repeat the same day over and over again.It's a terrific set and well worth picking up on Blu-ray although I will admit that even with the reduced price, it's still pretty steep for only 16 episodes. Still, it's 16 strong episodes (although there is a clinker or two most nicely mix horror, suspense and humor).Highly recommended.

Burt finds that a strange substance called MixMaster, leaked out of a secret laboratory, begins to infect the valley and turns the creatures into bizarre hybrids -- giant shrimps, omnivorous termite/maggots, a mineshaft \"ghost,\" or an acid-spitting reptilian plant.\"Tremors: The Complete Series\" was cancelled after only thirteen episodes, but those episodes are brilliant from beginning to end. And they have everything you'd expect from a Tremors series -- lots of big guns, explosions, orange goop, and highly imaginative ways to kill various monsters (including with weather balloons and tar).For the record: the MixMaster, the secret lab and the eccentric old scientist all seem rather hokey, but soon they mesh nicely into the existing \"Tremors\" mythology. Think a funnier, lighter \"X-Files\" vibe. And the writers do an excellent job, weaving clever plots with plenty of action, a bit of tragedy (Cletus and Project 4-12), and lots of hilarious dry humor, especially regarding Burt (\"Somebody get up on the wrong side of the bunker today?\").Gross is, as always, brilliant as the endearing survivalist Burt -- he has to start a survival school, wrangle with a hard-headed government rep, and deal with a town of hostile UFO-fanatics. Browne is decent as the new \"everyman lead,\" and there are some solid supporting performances by Lela Lee, Marcia Strassman, Sarah Rafferty, and especially Christopher Lloyd as a wonderfully eccentric scientist-turned-desert-hermit.Two of the cast aren't quite as endearing -- J.D.

For those acquainted with the movies, the TV program has a very familiar feel, as Michael Gross resumes the role of Burt Gummer, a heavily armed survivalist type, with a passion for killing the creatures who are responsible for the death of his wife.Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, and Gross were the stars of the original movie, with Gross assuming the lead role in the sequels, as the gun happy Gummer was the ideal character to continue the battle to save Perfection.

Melvin Plugg (Robert Jayne) is a developer looking to buy out the residents, while the charismatic Dean Norris (Breaking Bad, Under the Dome) plays W.D.

A Solinas \"ea_solinas\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "When we last left Our Heroes, they were on Apophis' ship, facing the impending destruction and/or enslavement of everyone on Earth.So unsurprisingly, the second season of \"Stargate SG-1\" can only get better from there on. In fact, this is when the clever, innovative sci-fi series really started to gel together, with more intriguing storylines, character arcs, and some new alien allies -- basically, it all blooms.Intending to blow up Apophis' ship, our heroes get captured by the Jaffa and thrown in a cell -- only to be unexpectedly rescued by Bra'tac (Tony Amendola), Teal'c's old teacher. As Earth mounts a pitiful defense against the Goa'uld, SG-1 joins with a small band of rebel Jaffa to stop Apophis' invasion -- but they may have to leave one of their number behind.Obviously the Goa'uld make things awkward throughout the season, with the second episode featuring Sam (Amanda Tapping) being possessed by a Goa'uld during a rescue mission -- but it seems that it's part of a rebel Goa'uld faction called the Tok'ra. Teal'c's (Christopher Judge) son is kidnapped and brainwashed, and Daniel (Michael Shanks) finds that his beloved wife is pregnant with Apophis' child.And of course, SG-1 has to deal with lots of other stuff -- insectile transformations, black holes, prison planets, Native American \"spirits,\" invisible bugs, hostile alien orbs, reliving their most traumatic memories in a VR world, and time traveling to 1969. And O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gets an ancient repository of knowledge downloaded into his head -- and he'll die if they can't reverse it.\"Stargate SG-1\" really got into its stride in the second season -- the basic Air-Force-versus-evil-headsnakes story gets expanded out into a bunch of arcs. We get new villains, some surprising new allies, hints about the true origins of the Stargates and the human race, and corrupt factions on Earth who use the spare Stargate for evil ends.The writing gets even steadier and the alien worlds more interesting -- even stuff that sounds goofy, like the planet of singing mushroom-people, somehow works. The drama is stronger, and the sci-fi usage of the Stargate ever more creative, such as when a black hole's gravity well keeps the gate open, and is slowly sucking Earth through the wormhole. Good, tense stuff.Of course, all the action and sci-fi is heavily tempered with comedy. Even in grim situations, there's usually at least a few funny moments, such as Daniel's tour of the custodial closet. And of course, the dialogue is priceless -- most of the good stuff comes from O'Neill (\"That's between you and your god. Oh, wait a minute! You are your god! That's a problem\"), but Teal'c (\"In my culture, I would be well within my rights to dismember you\") and the others usually get some good ones as well.Of the main cast, Amanda Tapping gets the juiciest role in this season -- Sam deals with the impending death of her father, becoming a Goa'uld host, and trying to deal with the feelings it left behind. Including a cute Tok'ra boyfriend. Yet when we see Sam's vulnerable sides, Tapping never lets her character be anything but a strong, capable military woman.But the other actors aren't neglected -- Shanks' Daniel grapples with the news that his wife is pregnant with Apophis' baby, while Teal'c faces losing his entire family. Anderson is brilliant as the quirky, capable O'Neill, but he really gets brilliant when Jack's brain is being overwritten -- he has to emote and communicate without a comprehensible word.The second season of \"Stargate SG-1\" is where the story began to really get great, building up a series of strong story arcs, funny dialogue, and strong characters.

There are a variety of reasons for this in each case.  With STARGATE, it is the increasingly complex storyline about the relations between various races and cultures with access to stargates.  Season One was basically your stargate-of-the-week format, each week an individual adventure with no real connections with any other episode.  This is the format usually preferred by network executives, since it allows new viewers to join a show without much background.  Serious fans, on the other hand, vastly prefer the complex storylines, where each week's episode does not stand on its own, but is embedded in an ongoing saga, almost like a chapter in a huge novel.  This has been and probably will continue to be an ongoing struggle between the creative talent and the network bureaucracy, though my own hope is that the success of shows like LOST will pave the way for more complex formats.Season Two does not tell a single unified story the way that FARSCAPE or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did, but it does start spinning out a largely political struggle about the five races (only a few that we have met by the end of the season) aligned against the Goa'uld.  The STARGATE story by the end of Season One was still a relatively simple affair; by the end of Season Two it was already sufficiently complex as to make following the details difficult for a newcomer.  But it was not only the season long arc; the individual episodes improved in quality as well as the writers came to know the characters better.  All in all, the improvement in the show from Season One was not unexpected, but it was delightful nonetheless.The only sour note in Season Two was the season finale.  Most shows try to build up to a dramatic season-ending episode that both sums up everything that happened in that season and propels the show into the next one.  The season finale for Season Two of STARGATE has to be one of the lamest ever devised.  Most of the problem is that most of the episode was constructed of segments of previous episodes that were simply replayed.  STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION used this method a few times.  My guess is that the latter show used it as a cheap way of creating a new episode.  If 20 minutes of your air time consisted of clips from old shows, then you had dramatically lowered your operating budget.  I do not know why STARGATE employed this method in the season finale, though perhaps they were over budget and had no choice but to go cheap.  Nonetheless, it was a surprisingly false note in an otherwise marvelous season.As with Season One, the story largely focused on the four members of the Stargate SG-1 team, with all other character functioning as supporting characters.  We are introduced to a number of characters who reappear in subsequent seasons, the most important being General Jacob Carter, Samantha's father.  His importance to the show is cemented in the two-part episode that introduces the Tok'ra, a group rebel Goa'uld opposed to the regular Goa'uld, only entering as symbiotes in willing hosts.  Since Sam's father is dying of cancer and the Tok'ra Selmak's host is dying, he is approached to become a host, since Selmak can cure the cancer.  This is also a wonderful resolution to one of my favorite moments of the season, when Sam's father pulls strings to get her admitted to the NASA space program as a potential astronaut.  Not knowing about her work with the Stargate program, he can't understand why she has no interest in going into outer space.All in all, this is a remarkable season for one of the finest Sci-fi series that television has seen.  Although I've never forgiven the Sci-fi channel for failing to renew FARSCAPE, keeping this fine show alive has at least partially redeemed them in my eyes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good first season is followed by a great second season", "unixReviewTime": 1149379200, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2006"},

Whitehead \"Werthead\"", "helpful": [16, 16], "reviewText": "Season 4 starts with dealing with the fall-out from the S3 finale. Four regular characters discover they are Cylons, Starbuck has reappeared despite last being seen in a Viper exploding above a gas giant and the fleet, having undergone a mysterious power failure, is under attack by a colossal Cylon fleet. The opening episode gives us the most impressive space battle yet as the fleet sustains heavy losses as it tries to escape. It's not too much of a spoiler to reveal it does escape, but the victory is marred by discontent over Starbuck's return and her claim that she has been to Earth. Adama decides to trust her and gives her a ship and crew to see if they can locate the planet, but Starbuck's orders do not prove popular and soon she has a mutiny on her hands...Meanwhile, the Cylons are in turmoil with the revelation that the mysterious 'Final Five' models are in the human fleet, and it isn't long before the gulf between the models begun by events on New Caprica explodes into a fractious civil war. Back in the fleet the four Cylons try to work out what is going on whilst concealing their identities, and Apollo begins a new career in the fleet's political system. Baltar finds himself the leader of a new cult fascinated by the Cylon's belief in one true god, and Roslin, dealing with the return of her cancer, is confronted by the prospect of her own mortality.Season 4 raises a lot of interesting issues and the story does move forward in an intriguing manner. However, the fact that what were supposed to be two full 20-episode seasons have been compressed into one is painfully obvious at times: Apollo's meteoric rise through the political ranks in just a few episodes and weeks of time in the series would have made more sense spread across a whole season and maybe a year of narrative time, and the Cylon Civil War happens mostly off-screen due to time and budgetary constraints. All of this really hits home in Episode 8, 'Sine Qua Non', which is possibly the most confused, bemusing and borderline nonsensical episode the series has ever done, moving characters into the positions they are needed in for plot purposes by having them behave totally out of character (Adama especially).However, once that painful act is accomplished, the final two episodes of the half-season return the series to a form it hasn't enjoyed since early Season 3. The controversial alliance between the humans and one of the Cylon factions raises a number of very interesting questions about the nature of both humanity and the Cylons, whilst the attack on the Hub is nothing short of breathtaking. But it is the mid-season finale, 'Revelations', which impresses the most. The best episode since the 'Exodus' two-parter, it moves quickly but doesn't feel rushed and is packed with moments of stunning acting (Eddie Olmos as Adama and Michael Hogan as Tigh give us the most dramatically intense scene of the series to date, whilst Jamie Bamber delivers his best performance as Lee is put in a really difficult position). The final two minutes or so of the episode represent one of the most talked-about moments of television in the last year, and will ensure that everyone comes back for the second half of the season, regardless of how much they charge for it on DVD.BSG: Season 4 is not the series at its best, but it does undertake a lot of necessary plot movements to set things up for the show's grand conclusion, and the episode 'Revelations' justifies the price of the set by itself.

This is what this genre does best - it holds up the fun house mirror for us to view ourselves in a distorted perspective.The mood of BSG tends to be quite \"Film Noir\".  When I looked up a definition in Wikipedia I found the following:\"Film noir is often described as essentially pessimistic. The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations (which, in general, they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating), striving against random, uncaring fate, and frequently doomed. The movies are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt. Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era.\"I thought this was a pretty good account of all seasons of BSG.  Another film noir factor to take into account is the general moral ambiguity.  It seems that the Cylons are the ones who are now taking the moral high ground and seem to be more open to weighing the pros and cons of each ethical decision.  They are becoming the principled ones and the humans have adapted an ethos of \"if it's different, it's bad!\" and not to be trusted.  Lifelong friendships are dismissed in an instant if this person (entity) turns out to be a \"toaster\".This may be a foolish question but I wonder if the Earth they found is real?

It is most unfortunate because the elements of greatness were there.  The overarching story was a good one and I was interesting in individual plot lines throughout.  The chief problem was characterization.More and more often as the series progressed, characters were written to do things both against their previous nature and against all common sense.  Both of the Adamas became simply laughable with over-acting the norm and erratic -- unbalanced? -- behavior expected.  I wouldn't trust Bill Adama to rearrange my silverware drawer, much less command a ship.  His always-to-excess drinking alone would have disqualified him from command, a trait shared by way too many of his crew.Mary McDonnell was the series best actor and I wanted to like Laura Roslin.  While a better leader than Bill Adama, she was also ultimately unworthy of my trust.  So, too, was I pulling for Kara Thrace and I really came to enjoy her portrayal by Katee Sackhoff.  Ultimately, I have no freaking idea who and what she was and could muster litter care.  And that was the problem in a nutshell with the series.I just ultimately didn't care whether or not they found earth or survived or lost to the Cylons.  The characters on balance were not very likable and were certainly unworthy of my admiration.  I said in another review of the series -- season 3? -- that the humans were so lacking in worthy quality that it might be better for humanity to be wiped away.  Ultimately, I think that the only character I really would have trusted was Athena and overall, I liked the Cylons more than the humans.  I realize that Ron Moore was trying to create a story where the lines were blurred as to which side should have been seen as the heroes and that is admirable.  It sadly just wasn't executed well.  When you simply stop caring about the characters and a need to finish what you started rather than a burning desire to know what happens in the story drives you forward episode-to-episode, you know a story has gone off the rails.I bet -- I even hope -- that the concept of Battlestar Galactic will be picked up again in a couple of decades.

The first episode begins with Starbucks' miraculous return to the fleet.  Quickly we see the murder of Cally, the growing friendship of Galen and Balter, Baltar's admission of guilt over the destruction of the colonies, and Baltar's growing cult-like status.  The final episode ends with a whimper as the fleet reaches Earth, only to discover that it has been ravaged by nuclear war.  Taken together, this season probably has more major events packed into such few episodes than any of the other episodes.  It is quite a testimony to the skills and abilities of the writers and directors.  Along the way, we have several great space battles, several key betrayals, and an illicit relationship between Tigh and a Six model.  This is a great viewing experience that combines drama, comedy, suspense, action and fantasy.  But this is not what makes this a great series.  No, what makes this a great series are the well-crafted illusions to mythology, religion and history.  First, the voyage to Earth parallels the spread of monotheism within the fleet led by Baltar, a former farmer from a poor colony who is ashamed of his past and heritage.  Second, we have a growing disenchantment with the leadership of the fleet as represented by President Roslin and Admiral Adama.  Together, they blends Moses's trek thru the desert with the gradual conversion of the Roman Empire from paganism to Christianity.  Then there is the return of Starbuck, a resurrection by any definition of the word, and her guidance fo the fleet to Earth.

{"reviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "asin": "B000ZU1KMW", "reviewerName": "Robert Moore", "helpful": [39, 61], "reviewText": "Warning!  Many, many, many spoilers below.  Do NOT read if you want to stay spoiler free.In watching Season 4.0 of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (when Universal released the first ten episodes of Season Two of BSG at the end of a near six month hiatus they dubbed the first half of the season 2.0 and the second half 2.5; that has been continued with 4.0 and 4.5), I kept thinking of soemthing one of the world's best known self-proclaimed BSG fiends, Joss Whedon, once said.  Sometimes you have to give fans what they need rather than what they want.  Not everything that happened in Season 4.0 was what any of us wanted, but in the end, I think we'll find that we got what we needed.  (BTW, Ron Moore asked Joss to direct an episode of BSG and was more than willing to do so, but preparation for his new series DOLLHOUSE, which will pair BUFFY and ANGEL alumna Eliza Dushku with BSG alumnus Tahmoh Penikett, placed demands on him that prevented him from being able to do so.  Part of me deeply regrets this, because my two favorite shows of all time are BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  As Jack White says, \"Oh well, oh well, oh well.\")No show in the history of TV has had more truly great and shocking endings than BSG.  BUFFY had two season finales that were as good as any I've seen (Seasons Two and Five -- the climatic scene from the Season Five finale, \"The Gift,\" was recently voted in landslide fashion on the official Emmy 2008 website as the Most Memorable Moment in TV history), but because Joss Whedon was always and wisely terrified of the cancellation of his shows, he would not end any season on a cliffhanger.  Ron Moore and David Eick have bravely ended each season with some of the greatest cliffhangers in TV history.  My favorite may have been the end of Season Three:  the Cylon fleet bearing down on the Colonials, who will not be able to engage their FTL (faster-than-light) engines for several minutes, the sitar-drive version of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" playing in the background.  Apollo goes to investigate a mysterious bogey only to discover the deceased Starbuck flying a Viper as shiney and clean as the day it came off the assembly line.  She comforts him with the words, \"It's going to be alright.  I've been to earth.  And I'm going to take us there.\"  Then the breathtaking CGI shot of a \"camera\" pulling back over the two Vipers, through the Colonial fleet, through the Cylon fleet, through the nebula, then across the universe until it comes to rest on a beautiful blue planet showing the continent of North America basking in the sun.  It was a jaw dropping moment and the question was whether Season Four could pick up successfully at that moment.Well, of course it could.  And did.  After learning the identity of four members of the Final Five we knew that the final season would primarily deal with two major questions:  1) Who is the final Cylon? and 2) Will they reach earth and what will they find there if they do?  I think everyone would have put money on the first question being answered first and the second one in the final episode of the series.  But shockingly the second question was answered first, and in the finale seconds of the final episode before the hiatus.Much of 4.0 focused on Starbuck striving to convince Adama and everyone else that whe was not a Cylon and that she really did know the way to earth.  Though many harbor deep suspicions, in the end Starbuck is able to persuade the fleet to go where she believes earth can be found.  In an absolutely brilliant moment, she succeeds.  I had managed to avoid spoilers (in fact, though I was a pretty well known poster on the official BSG board on Scifi.com, I stopped visiting there in order to avoid spoilers) so I had absolutely no idea that they were going to reach earth so much earlier than anyone had assumed.  Indeed, even in interviews leading up to the episode, Ron Moore indicated that they would get to earth before the end of the series, not giving any clues that in fact it would be in the very next episode.  So a viewer's first shock is that they found earth at all.  Even as the Raptors and other atmospheric spacecraft descend to the earth's surface, another shock takes over.  In one of the great one shots I've ever seen on TV, a camera focuses in close on the bandaged hand of Adama, scooping up liveless soil, a Geiger counter registering high levels of radioactivity.  The camera raises up slowly to register the blank expressions of Adama and, standing beside him, Roslin, who utters the shot's lone word, \"Earth.\"  The model 3 Cylon known as D'Anna walks up beside them, horror on her face, as Sharon and Helo walk behind them.  The camera then loosely follows the two of them as they walk all the way to the far right, stopping along the way to register the reactions of the other major surviving characters on the show.  First Cylons Anders and Tory, the same expression of despair on their faces.  Then cutting in front of them Apollo, who walks further to reveal Caprica Six in the background, Baltar sitting in the foreground, and Tyrol behind her.  Six walks past Dee in the foreground over to Colonel Tigh, lightly touching his arm.  Past Apollo, who has stopped walking, past Leoben, briefly back to Sharon and Helo who continue walking, to Starbuck, who turns and walks over to where they have stopped.  The camera continues on its own to reveal a body of water and a destroyed bridge, ruins everywhere.  It is a scene that will remind any viewer strongly of the end of PLANET OF THE APES.  I have to add that there is no hint that this was New York or any other city.  Though one ruin clearly features a large carved cross, apparently denoting a Christian building of some sort, there are no other signs of what they have found.  Many assume that the bridge is the Brooklyn Bridge, but anyone even minimally familiar with that bridge's design knows that it is not.  Some argue that it isn't really earth, but I just don't think that argument holds water.4.0 was not very happy.  These were sad, upsetting, bleak, despairing episodes.  But I truly believe that they were what we needed and not what we wanted.  Most of us would have had more fighting, more combat, more huge space battles.  But we wouldn't have broken new ground or challenged its viewers.  The mark of a great show is that it takes you to places that you couldn't expect existed.  Most of us have impoverished imaginations and as a result think in small, hackneyed ways.  I wasn't always happy with Season Four.  My favorite character is Sharon Agathon and on various boards I speculated that her story had largely ended in Season Three, after the last major question (What would she do when she found out that Hera was alive and that Roslin had stolen her from Sharon?) was answered (Answer:  She would do whatever she needed to get back Hera, but nothing to harm Roslin.).  Season Four showed her as an anti-Cylon zealot, even assassinating a Six who was striving to create some sort of working arrangement with the humans.  We got fewer humorous encounters between Six and Baltar.  We didn't get to visit interesting planets.  Happy times were not had.  But as I've reflected back over the show as a whole, I have been amazed at the astonishing journey that it has taken us on.  In fact, the show in 4.0 even departed from so much of the political allegory that dominated the first two and a half seasons.We are now set up for the final ten episodes of a show that has completely redescribed what it is possible to do within the confines of a science fiction show.  In part it did this by refusing to succumb to a single one of the tried and true conventions of the genre.  And it did this by never repeating itself.  Along with another show that was launched in 2004, LOST, it has helped create a new kind of television narrative:  the very long story.  Other shows had attempted this to some degree.  Each season of BUFFY told a self-contained story, with some elements that carried over from one season to the next.  THE X-FILES spent several seasons on the alien colonization story (though more than half of each season's episodes were standalone episodes).  BABYLON 5 had elements that took the first four seasons to resolve (though there were a number of reasons the narrative wasn't as successful as it should have been).  But LOST and BSG will be the first two that will have told a single story through the course of the show with a beginning, middle, and an end.  Other shows are following in this path.  I think it makes for tremendous television, even if it doesn't always pull in a lot of viewers.Finally, I'd like to engage in a little speculation.  I've made a couple of predictions before.  Both of them turned out correct, even if one of them was only partially correct.  I think I was the first person on the Internet to predict how Sharon would get Hera; because I knew they had only 42 minutes for Sharon to somehow get to the Cylon basestar and back with Hera, I predicted that someone would kill her (with the Cylon prohibition of suicide, I knew she would kill herself) and that she would grab Hera and return to the Colonial fleet, possibly on a heavy raider.  Well, I didn't know they had a Raptor on board, but I got close.  (I know I was the first to post this theory on the official board and it only appeared elsewhere after that).  The second prediction was that Tyrol was one of the Final Five.  What I got wrong was that three others would also be revealed.  My third prediction has been a short list of the final Cylon.  I don't have room to give all of my reasons for my theory, but it hinges on a passage in a book that Roslin reads aloud to Adama on the Temple of the Five in \"The Eye of Jupiter.\"  She reads, \"The five pillars represent the five priests who are devoted to the one whose name cannot be na--\" and she is cut off by Adama, who says, \"Laura.\"  I argue that this is a literary convention in which the one whose name cannot be named is indirectly revealed.  Basically, I believe the key to the Final Five is that they are crucial to helping Roslin lead the survivors to earth.  Tigh, Tyrol, Tory, and Anders all beautiful fit this.  My other argument is that the final cylon could not have been in a position to respond to the song that the other four heard at the end of Season Four.  Using these two, I came up with the short list of Billy, Kat, and Elosha.  Of the three, Billy was closest to Roslin and he remains my first choice.  Elosha was not, I thought, a sufficiently important character to satisfy the requirements of the final cylon.  Kat slightly fits the bill, and Starbuck's talking to her photo just before they get to earth strengthens her case.  I still think the final Cylon is most likely Billy.  But unless Ron Moore has flat out been lying, neither Adama (especially not Zak) nor Starbuck is the final Cylon.  We'll see if my third and final prediction is correct or not.But there is no question that BSG has helped redefine what it is possible to do on a television series.  It has taken narrative to new levels, has introduced a moral and spiritual darkness that surpasses even THE SOPRANOS, and has shown that you can completely redefine an other moribund genre, making Science Fiction that speaks more to adults than the teenagers.  I can't wait for the final ten episodes.Edit -- 1/18/09 -- Well, I was wrong on the final Cylon (if, that is, Tigh is correct).  I was half right in my reasoning.  I was convinced that it couldn't be someone who was with the fleet and that they were most likely dead.  But I was equally confident that they were supporters of Laura Roslin.  To that degree the person currently revealed as the final Cylon doesn't make a lot of sense.  But one of the things about being the executive producers is that things in the end don't have to make a lot of sense.  That said, the Season 4.5 opener was a stunning episode in many, many ways, and further proof of just how great this show is.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "More brilliant episodes of one of television's landmark series", "unixReviewTime": 1224115200, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2008"},

We hear throughout the series of the gods (human belief) and god ( cylon belief) belief systems and which was right/true Vs. the other false god(s) and in season three it really heats up and is one of the major factors for the war. I didn't feel that this show was a good platform to try to rationalize religion, social/wealth status  and race issues that have plagued us forever the way shows like MASH was able to effectively address during its run on TV. Yes, its a drama, but its a scifi/fantasy drama and it wasn't near as effective nor as convincing as other shows like Mash's superior writing, acting and directing teams talents.The shows writers creat tension for the show by having these constant  riffs between the military and civilian populations that for me made little sense when the entire race was fighting for survival. Not everyone would use weapons, but would provide support for the troops and the population in one form or another. Yes, there would be issues, but everyone (all were soliders) was fighting for their lives and their race. Yet, we would rarely ever see people join the fight as troops or pilots like we saw during WWII and when you think of the stakes involved the shows creators/writers really blow this need for unity and patriotism that saved the day back then as well as for their war.I don't know about you, but half way into season two I had had enough of Galus Baltar (James Callis) who did a great job at being the King Antagonist of all time!!! I felt his role turned into some kind of comic book character like the road runner (at least I like the road runner) who never received a scratch no matter what was thrown at him. Baltar would have been killed more times than all the humans and cylon's combined if his character resembled something other than pure fantasy.All the mutinies and drunkeness and disobeying of orders that were in this story would have been the end of the human race in any other show.Look. I'm am in the middle on this show and how I rated it because of all its flaws and its OTT (over the top) stories/plotlines and silly characterizations of some of the cast. I liked the first BSG (1978) a little more than this one because of their character portrayals and stories. That said, I really liked this shows special effects and action scenes over the original series and between that and most of the casts acting abilities help to still make this a decent scifi series to sit back and watch.There is a fair amount of cursing and their version of the F&#8230;word (fracking) being used a lot ( you how many service persons like to swear a lot) to keep from being rated for mature audiences. There is several sex/love making scenes through ought the series especially Dr. Baltar's character without any exposed breasts.Again, this was a mostly fun to watch series especially the first two seasons with the third and fourth more of a challenge to sit through. 3 stars.Ps.

The overall plot was basically incomprehensible, there were so many holes and so much illogic that it should have been awful--but it wasn't. I've watched other popular sci-fi shows, and found them blah after a few episodes, the characters one dimensional, the story arc predicatble. I was watching a discussion of the BSG show with Ron Moore, and something he said finally clicked: we learn more from our heroes by their flaws than their virtues. The characters on BSG are VERY flawed--they're just plain wrong a lot, they use their positions for personal purposes, they can't figure out who they really love, they shift allegiances according to what serves the moment--and that makes them immensely intriguing. Is Baltar a saint or a devil? How about Roslin--does the end justify the means? Is Adama a hypocrit? What the frakk is wrong with Starbuck? And how can you not forgive Lee for being such a goody-two shoes when he had come through the battle of the bulge? The scene with Apollo and Starbuck in the ring in priceless--what better way to prove how much you love someone than by knocking their teeth out. Not that anybody's teeth every get knocked out, fortunately. It's one of those seemingly illogical things, that after as many blows to the jaw as they all take, any of them have any front teeth at all. And what's with the way the sixes dress? I mean, really, put some clothes on. The heat can't be all that good in those big drafty ships. So, in sum, all the plot holes and illogical points are so overpowered by the amazing acting and perfect casting and great character development and endless surpises and REALLY BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE that you HAVE to keep watching. When Baltar says things like, \"I never really belonged to you, you appropriated me\" or \"You're right. I wouldn't trust me either\" you want to cheer the writers. The subtlety of that is something few shows can achieve. And then, of course, there's the HUGE pay-off at the end. Not many series can boast that. Most dribble away into some underwhelming resolution that seems to be there just because the show has to end somehow. I REALLY want more--not a prequel. I want to know what happens next--how come only one dna line makes the cut? And really? People as social (or anti-social) as Adama and Chief would choose human isolation? You can't even be anti-social if you don't have something to be anti TO.

The same can be said for this first half of Season 4, as literally every single episode crackles with dramatic development, action, and even philosophy.I won't give away any major spoilers here, but this season begins with the aftermath of the Gaius Baltar (James Callis) trial and the miraculous \"return\" of Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff).  From there, it also deals with the revelation of four of the final five Cylons (and how they deal with that knowledge), as well as a potential human/cylon alliance in order to find Earth.  There is so much going on this season both plot-wise & character-wise that I could write for paragraphs and still not cover it all!  This set also ends with a cliffhanger that you will NEVER see coming (even if you know it is indeed coming).Again, mirroring what I liked about the third season of this show, the beginning of this effort is just as much about the Cylons as it is about the humans.  To me, the human/Cylon relationship has always been the backbone of this show, and this season gets off to a great start by exploring that relationship in even greater depth.Of course, as per usual, the acting and character drama is also incredible.  Each member of the large ensemble cast is given a juicy role (no one is left out), while the show even proves it can survive for a few episodes without a strong Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) presence.  We're talking LOST-like character progression (the highest compliment I can give a TV show).Overall, this beginning half of Season 4 continues the strong BSG tradition of crafting intense, character-driven drama that truly makes you care about the participants.

Although Stingray was completely under the radar, and Michael is always blip number one, there are still similarities. Michael's skill at going undercover and improvising a role comes to mind. Also, Stingray's stories were a trade in 'favors', and Michael and friends often help someone as a favor, or for only expenses. Both had secretive but evidently quite successful histories in secret ops.One of the things I enjoy most about Burn Notice are the little 'spy tips' that grace every show. Some of them make sense, some are utter nonsense, and some of them I'm not too sure about, but they're all fun.Another thing I like about it is the way in which the 'bad guys' often come to grief in very satisfying, often funny ways. The late 2nd season episode where Michael foils a bank robbery is hilarious.Whether it makes sense all the time or not, obviously the writers of this show care, and are putting a good effort into each script. That makes up for any sins and makes for a quite entertaining show.Season One obviously contains the \"origin story\" in the pilot, which is a big advantage. However, this series is remarkably consistent throughout its run, and all the episodes are of very consistent quality as well. Although there have been a few stand out shows that I particularly enjoyed, I can't really think of any \"stinkers\" that I had to overlook.

Sure production values, directing, and F/X are wonderful as well, but it is the cast that truly makes this show work. The chemistry between Jeffrey Donovan, Gabrielle Anwar, Bruce Campbell, and Sharon Gless makes it worth watching alone. I have always enjoyed spy type TV series, but this is an interesting approach to it. An agent is retired, given a burn notice, while he is still quite young and capable. Him figuring out why is the main focus. Add in the fact his friends and family are trying to find him work which is mostly of a detective nature and you have a good mix of action and comedy. I highly recommend it, especially if you are a fan of series like Magnum PI. Though \"Burn Notice\" is a bit more \"MacGyver\"-ish than Magnum PI, you still see the similarity.I couldn't help but make some comparisons to that series with a handsome hero narrating his thoughts, good dramatic stories, interesting and often resourceful friends, beautiful locations, and some very funny comedy thrown in at the right times. I think Donovan is perfect for the role. I recall when I saw CSI the first season why William Petersen was so good in the role. If you had seen him in \"Manhunter\" several years prior it was like the role was designed for him. I swear this role in \"Burn Notice\" is designed for Jeffrey Donovan.

The story is about a fired American spy, who seems to have some lethal enemies up high, but the episodes are - well - episodic, as he takes on various violent jobs to make a living while trying to find out who did what to him in DC.

In addition, Donovan also has a \"real\" family with whom he has issues - an annoying mother (Sharon Gless) and an irresponsible brother (whose character actually seems to develop over time.) The acting ranges from appropriately deadpan (the lead actor, Jeffrey Donovan, who is good here and was even better in the much mourned Touching Evil) to appropriately over-the-top (various villains.)

Sadly, I am not most people...I've never found a good way to hide a gun in a bathing suit.\"When you're a spy, getting a burn notice means that you've been officially deemed unreliable by your covert brethren, and that you're no longer wanted in the cloak-and-dagger community. Always good at rubbing people the wrong way, international spy Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan, TOUCHING EVIL) is in Nigeria brokering a deal with a terrorist when he learns of his burn notice over a cell phone. Barely skedaddling out of Nigeria with his life, Michael somehow finds himself stranded in his hometown of Miami, with his finances frozen, his options about nil, and former friends and colleagues keeping far, far away.Michael decides to lay low for a while and, because a man has just got to make a living somehow, becomes a makeshift private investigator and troubleshooter. But, even as he takes on the criminal elements in Miami, his overriding objective remains finding out why he was blacklisted. But it's hard going as, mysteriously, no one will tell him anything. Meanwhile, various spooks are monitoring his every move. So, something's going on...Yup, I dig this show. The USA Network's BURN NOTICE proved to be one of the more pleasant surprises of 2007. Not having seen a lot of Jeffrey Donovan's work, I'm still quickly becoming a fan. He brings a wry, deadpan charm to the show, and he looks like there's stuff just churning underneath his character's self-contained exterior. And it's exactly because of this distant persona that I appreciate Michael Westen providing a very quotable, \"been there, done that\" voice-over narration. This device not only engages us further but also makes us privy to Westen's cynical inner musings, as well as giving us frequently amusing first hand advice on various stuff. No, it's not exactly life lessons that he's imparting. Rather, it's more of a tutorial on espionage and breaking heads. Y'know, the cool stuff. For example, Westen, on fighting: \"You don't want to break the little bones in your hands, so you look for a bathroom, which has plenty of hard edges and surfaces.\" On guns: \"Guns make you stupid. Better to fight your wars with duct tape. Duck tape makes you smart.\" Or on setting traps: \"A good trap doesn't scare people, it makes them curious.\" And, so on and et cetera. Dude's often wry observations make my day. Someone should put together a quotation book, because I'd shell out.Chemistry rears its beautiful head. Donovan's supporting cast is very good, and two of them are very engaging. Westen's tiny circle of trust consists of three folks. There's his sexy and fiery Irish ex-girlfriend Fiona (gorgeous Brit, Gabrielle Anwar). Fi is an ex-IRA agent and into mayhem and violence, and, of her, Westen unequivocably states, \"I am NOT hooking up with her. I need her for tactical support.\" (sure, sure). Slovenly Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell, who's casually let himself go) is Westen's long-time buddy and a semi-retired spy. Now Sam helps Westen out on cases, and vice versa. And then there's Westen's irritating dragon of a mother, Madeline (Sharon Gless, CAGNEY & LACEY), who is a champion emotional blackmailer. Gless is effective at channeling Doris Roberts from EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. So if you're hating on Gless's character, then she's just being brilliant.BURN NOTICE, with its first season's 12 episodes, brings it with suspense and some action, and with humor and a rocky romance, even if I could do without the fractured family stuff. It's a well-done lighthearted spy & crime drama, with an element of the sting, and it left me craving for more episodes. Jeffrey Donovan might just have found his breakout role in the glib and uber capable but emotionally detached Michael Westen. Certainly, he makes for a compelling character. I enjoy how he uses his Special Ops training to satisfyingly one-up Miami's teeming lowlifes. And, all along, there's slow progress being made on the whole burn notice arc. The writing is smart, the production values are terrific. And it doesn't hurt that BURN NOTICE is filmed in sun-drenched, visually arresting Miami, so give the show some style points. I definitely don't have anything against babes and bikinis and margaritas and martinis.Michael Westen, who dislikes his hometown, might beg to differ, but, hey, bienvenido a Miami.

I used to watch him in The Pretender and Crossing Jordan and loved him, so I began to see what this was like.  It's a great show and I make sure not to miss any episodes.  Speaking of episodes, this is how season 1 plays out;PILOT - Michael Weston, a contract agent for various agencies including the CIA, finds that a burn notice has been issued for him. Stranded in Miami, he takes the case of a caretaker accused of stealing millions from his boss.IDENTITY - Weston is roped into helping his mother's friend get back money she lost in a scam, but Fi and Sam may ruin everything with their bumbling and bickering.FIGHT OR FLIGHT - Michael's landlord, Oleg, is having a problem with one of his waitresses. She hasn't come into work because she witnessed a crime committed by a man who just happens to be a member of a local drug cartel. Michael is (mostly) happy to look into it, as he also continues his investigation into who stuck him with his burn notice.OLD FRIENDS - Michael's brother is back in town, and he involves him in the search for a friend's daughter for less than pure motives. Elsewhere, an agent with a grudge comes after Michael.FAMILY BUSINESS - Michael takes on arms dealers for an airport worker, while Nate obsesses about the car and their dad's will.UNPAID DEBTS - Michael helps out an old SEAL buddy of Sam's who has gotten himself on the wrong side of a smuggler while trying to repossess his boat, and a new agent hits town set on making Michael's life miserable since he won't give up on finding his burn notice.BROKEN RULES - Michael works to rid a community in little Havana of a crime boss, all the while baiting Jason Bly at the risk of his family and friends.WANTED MAN - Fiona decides to try bounty-hunting, but then convinces Michael to help prove the man innocent.HARD BARGAIN - A slightly dim house sitter's fianc&eacute;e has been kidnapped, and Sam guilts Michael into a rescue while he's negotiating with a D.C. bureaucrat to stop the burn notice.FALSE FLAG - Michael makes plans to leave Miami, but has to do one last job - locate a woman's missing son - so he can get a new identity.LOOSE ENDS PART 1 - Phillip Cowan has arrived in Miami, but Michael has to put him off when a job involving heroin and blackmail goes south.LOOSE ENDS PART 2 - With Cowan's bosses now tracking him, Michael must protect his family and rescue Sam all before his own capture if he doesn't move fast enough.To elaborate just that little bit more, a 'burn notice' is when a spy is cut off, no jobs, nothing.

In effect, a burn notice is a termination of current employment where an agent is left in the field without identity, backup, funds or anything that might help him. Happening in the middle of an illegal transaction with killers is not the best time to be notified.Weston escapes and lands in Miami. Using his knowledge and special ops skills, he sets up a place to stay, contacts his old friend Sam (Bruce Campbell) who helps set him up with some work. He also meets up with past girlfriend Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) - an ex-IRA bomber that he left behind, and his mother (Sharon Gless), a chain smoking retiree.Things are not the best he could hope for.The character of Michael Weston is charismatic and yet hard at the same time. He has difficulty relating to what you and I might think of as normal civilians. Put him in the midst of a group of soldiers discussing weapons and explosives and he's in his element. Sitting next to a young boy whose father has been threatened by a rich employer who has set him up to take the fall for a fake theft and that's a whole different ballgame. As played by Donovan, the character is believable and easy on the eyes for female fans.Most of the episodes consist of two stories running side by side. The ongoing story consists of Michael trying to discover who issued his burn notice so he can go back to doing what he does best. Whoever placed him there has let him know in no uncertain terms that he is to remain in Miami and let it go. FBI agents that follow him around, NSA members who visit him and more attempt to get that through his head. But Michael doesn't choose to take this situation lying down.The second storylines involve Michael either being recruited to help someone in need or taking on jobs that his friend Sam puts him in contact with. Anything from a kidnapping to the fake theft mentioned above requires him to use his cunning and skills to help someone in need.What I thought made this series work more than anything was the interplay between characters. Not only that but the casting choices make this work like a Swiss watch. Each actor has his or her piece to play and they do it to perfection.Campbell has found his niche here playing the friend who was once involved in covert actions as well. Sam not only helps Michael but feeds information (usually false) to the Feds who keep an eye on Michael.Fiona as played by Anwar offers an elegant looking woman with tremendous sex appeal but who has a deadly side that she lets loose now and then. Even then she offers some of the most humorous lines in the show as she matter of factly considers eliminating anyone who gives Michael trouble. This let's kill `em attitude coming from this petite woman makes for an interesting character.The series offers plenty of action, lots of thoughtful plotlines, a ton of subtle humor and even a touch of romance. With the second season getting ready to begin this summer, now is the time to pick up season one and get caught up. The cliffhanger at season's end will be a great jumping on point this summer. Until then, give this DVD release a try. It's worthy of adding to any collection.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"BURN NOTICE\" IS HOT", "unixReviewTime": 1214524800, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2008"},

His way of being placidly befuddled by all things female is a great counter to his spy smarts.  Donovan fits the role so perfectly it is as though the series was written for him.The plots are light and fast blends of stuff - CIA operative spy stuff, Miami lowlife stuff, romantic stuff, family stuff, and other stuff.  Fi is perfectly Fi - her pretty, petite, and generally nearly naked self, loving to blow things up and so very eager to shoot anything that moves.  Michael takes Fi home to have dinner with mom, and Fi turns into the sweet and innocent \"girl next door\" - laugh out loud funny.  The somewhat slovenly and slightly alcoholic Sam, a womanizer (but not in the typical misogynistic way) adds just the right presence.  Madeline round out the fine core quartet.Only one thing marred my otherwise unqualified enthusiasm for Burn Notice. Mom Madeline's chain smoking.  Watching someone smoke is about the same as watching someone barf - flat out nauseating. And it generates two obvious flaws in the character -- Madeline's beautiful complexion and her sparkling white teeth -- no chain-smoker has either of those.  Not that the series is meant to be realistic - no appeal in that!  But if Madeline were scripted with an interesting addiction or predilection, rather than this dull and repulsive one, the role could have been enhanced.

But as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear.  Griffin Dunne's direction of Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a bit careless at times as it strays from rational plot development, but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to patch up the holes he created.Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his coke-addicted masseuse/sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York, waiting for the summer when he is to join his anthropologist father on a field trip to South America (a father he knows only from letters and videos), when a drug bust abruptly changes their lives: one of Liz's wealthy clients Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland) rescues the down and out family and moves them to his ten acre estate, the epitome of wealth and power. In exchange for being Osborne's private masseuse, Liz and Finn can live in the mansion with the 'filthy rich' Osbornes - daughter Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his physician lead Liz on the drying out path and Finn bonds with Osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the disparity in poor versus wealthy, the living situation works - for a while.  Incidents occur to alter feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, a turning point for the film and Finn's view of the Osborne family.  Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they manage to discover the truth about Finn's troubling incident - and also about the fierce disease of the wealthy class.The film uses many clips of tribal activity during the film, drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes. For this viewer that works well, but when the director elects to place tribal individuals in full regalia within the context of the Osborne estate, the concept feel contrived, as though the audience has to be forced to 'get it'. The various subplots between maid Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn and the introduction of an obese retarded chalk artist Whitney (Branden Williams) push the credibility edge of emphasizing the line between the wealthy and the 'lower class', but the performances by Sutherland, Lane, and Yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive the film's lapses.  Not a great film but one with a lot of worthy ideas splashed around on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction.

But it's actually much more than that. The show revolves around Hank Moody (David Duchovny), an author who's been in a bit of a writer's slump ever since his last novel was published seven years ago. Hank longs to return to his hometown of New York City, but remains in California because his former lover, Karen (Natascha McElhone), lives there, along with their teenage daughter, Becca (Madeleine Martin). Hank is still very much in love with Karen, and it's pretty obvious that she still loves him, too. Unfortunately, Karen's engaged to stuffy Bill (Damian Young), and Hank unwittingly has sex with Bill's 16-year-old daughter, Mia (Madeline Zima), who eventually ends up blackmailing Hank and trying to take credit for his latest manuscript. What a mess!\"Californication\" also boasts a strong supporting cast. Evan Handler plays Hank's best friend and agent, Charlie. Poor Charlie and his wife, Marcy (Pamela Adlon), experience some problems in the bedroom that lead to both of them cheating on each other with Charlie's hot young assistant, Danni (Rachel Miner). Handler and Adlon are amazingly funny on screen, and they play off each other very well: They're the funniest television couple since Lucy and Ricky Ricardo!By far, the best thing about this show is its sense of humor. There are some incredibly funny scenes in \"Californication\" that definitely are among the most hilarious moments in TV history, and that's saying a lot. From Hank throwing up on Bill's priceless painting to the office dominatrix scenes to the three-way/orgy culmination, there are plenty of great scenes to go around. I don't remember the last time a TV show made me laugh so hard.The first four or five episodes of the show were a little bumpy, but then \"Californication\" evolved into a great program about love, relationships, and self-discovery. The entire cast is brilliant, and most of the episodes are incredibly touching. I especially loved the last scene of the final episode, which came as a complete surprise and resulted in a very happy ending, at least for now.Overall, \"Californication\" is a surprising success.

HOWEVER, once in awhile, I either feel compelled to add my voice to the chorus of praise, or I happen to see a season in a very compressed timeframe and can articulate something resembling a coherent thought.Such was the case with Season 1 of CALIFORNICATION.  I saw the brief first season in about a one week time span, and here are my thoughts.CALIFORNICATION pretty much  hinges on the ability of David Duchovny to make an insanely unlikeable person likeable.  He plays Hank Moody, the smuggest of writers, a best seller who loathes the movie made of this work.  It is the making of this movie that brought him, his long-time lover Karen and their daughter Becca from NYC to LA.  Upon arriving in LA, Hank and Karen grew quickly apart.  Hank now lives alone and wallows in self-pity, self-loathing (which he turns on everyone around him) and enormous amounts of sex, booze and smoking.  He has an almost magical touch with women wherever he goes, and each 30 minute episode may find him bedding several different women.His only bright spots are the times he spends with his daughter Becca (a stone-faced girl of around 13 or 14 who plays rock guitar, has her father's smart and observant mouth and longs deeply for mom and dad to get back together).  Hank also spends an awful lot of very hot & fraught time with his ex, because we feel that while she has found the love of a stable and rich man who plans to marry her...she is still very much drawn to the exciting & dangerous Hank.Duchovny mostly pulls it off.  If you only know him as Fox Mulder, then his performance here is almost a revelation.  He's disgusting, foul-mouthed, and always unshaven.  I told my wife, \"it strikes me that he would smell bad.\"  He's also super-smart and tosses off the most amazingly tart observations on everyone and everything around him.  Duchovny is a smart enough person himself that we actually believe he understands what his character is saying.  (Given the recent revelations about Duchovny and his deteriorating relationship with HIS family...there may be more of him in Hank than I'd like.)  Most of the time, Hank is despicable.  We laugh at his antics and at his credulity-stretching ease with picking up women (although some of the sex scenes are among the funniest parts of the show).  But we also feel the genuine love he has for Karen and Becca.  He's mostly a good father, in a casual California way...and his love for these two women in his life is obvious and believable...thus his character is redeemed to some extent.  He is a man tormented by the mess he's made of his life...but also a slave to his passions.His closest friend is his agent Charlie, played by Evan Handled (Charlotte's husband in SEX AND THE CIY).  Charlie is married to Marcy...but there relationship has tamed down and he's acting out his S&M; fantasies with his secretary Dani.You might get the idea that CALIFORNICATION is not for kids...and you'd be correct!  It is foul-mouthed, contains much explicit sex and generally depicts degenerate lifestyles.But the writing is tart, and much of the acting is first rate.  Duchovny is very good, even if you don't care for the guy he is playing very often.  He balances the role neatly.  Karen is played by Natascha McElhone (the only person in the show, it seems, who won't do nudity).  McElhone has the most ferocious cheekbones!  She does a nice job, although her character seems to be stuck at roughly the same spot all the time.  Evan Handler does well at letting his freak-flag fly and Pamela Adlon, who plays  his wife Marcy, is a revelation.  She reminds me a little bit of Suzie Essman (from CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM) but far racier.  I look forward to seeing her character's progression in Season 2.  Less successful are Madeleine Martin as Becca (I hate, really hate, to say something bad about a child performer...but Becca may actually be more annoying than Hank because her face is virtually incapable of expression, her hair is horrible and her rock vocals are unbearable) and Madeline Zima as Mia, the woman Hank sleeps with in episode one, who turns out to be the 16 year-old daughter of Karen's fianc&eacute;.  This leads to many awkward situations, as you can imagine...but Ms. Zima is unconvincing in the role.  Also disappointing is Rachel Miner's Dani, who plays Charlie's kinky secretary and only manages about 2 expressions in the entire season.Overall, I recommend the series for adults who don't mind some really rough material.  It is witty (seldom laugh-out-loud funny) and the debauchery is sometimes jaw-dropping.  Duchovny earned a Golden Globe for this role, and while he might not have been my first choice for the award, he is certainly perfectly up to this complicated role.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Debauched in the extreme...but redeemed by Duchovny's performance", "unixReviewTime": 1235779200, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2009"},

It is amazing to realize that it is only 7 episodes for the character, plot and drama development is so thorough and realistic another show would need at least double the episodes to achieve it.  The basic plot is a teacher who finds out he is dying of cancer and thru unexpected situations gets the opportunity to make a great deal of money thru manufacturing meth.  He does so to make money for his family to be able to live on after he dies.  But the show is about so much more than this.  Every character is addicted to something and the introduction into the dark world of drugs is terrifyingly realistic.  This is honestly one of the best shows ever to air on television.

These characters are all believable, necessary and the intertwining of their lives is seamless.The show also succesfully combines deep psychological profiles of each character mixed with the heavy, often disturbing drama.  And the plot always serves a purpose, is realistic no matter how heavy, and is in no way gratuituous.  And with this show we also get one of the best duos ever in Walt and Jesse.  When Jesse, Aaron Paul, a former student of Walt, Bryan Cranston, joins him in the making of meth a perfect chemistry is formed.  BREAKING BAD also provides the occasional comic break that helps alleviate the heavy drama.  This series is a must for its great acting, superb writing and directing and totally unique premise.  If it sounds like any other series you have seen believe me when I say it is not.  The blu ray of course adds a dimension to the series over that of the dvd.

As it turns out, the story line is so inventive and so believable that it is hard not be be drawn into the perils of these characters which are so totally under water. The story on the face of it is so tense, that the show's creator had to add to the premise the fact that the brother in law of the Walter White (Brian Cranston) is a lead DEA agent, and, in most regards, a pretty good one. Perhaps one of the only improbabilites of the first season is that this DEA agent comes so close to gathering evidence which implicates Walter, but he doesn't catch on.Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the story is seeing the extent to which people will do totally out of character things, things which are not only illegal (as one may think about drug business as a victimless crime), but violently illegal, including multiple murders. The acting by Cranston and Brian Paul, his \"dealer\" is superb, worthy of their Emmy wins. I must also give a good word for Raymond Cruz, who does a character far, far different from his police detective role on \"The Closer / Major Crimes\".

He played Hal, a simple Dad with simple values and an unbeatable love for his family. Who would have thought that he can take a character with the same basic love of his family and create something incredibly unique from that. In Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston plays Chemistry professor Walter White who's married with a handicap son who suffers from Cerebral Palsy and a child on the way.One day Walter is hit with the ultimate bombshell as he finds he has inoperable lung cancer and has little time left to live. Walter realises that he can't assure his families financial security for the little time he has left being a teacher. He hears about a raid on a crystal meth lab that seizes millions of dollars worth of drugs which he decides that he must be a part of that. He knows how to make the best crystal meth ever seen, but not how to get it on the streets which is why he must enlist the help of his former student and drug pusher Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul).I honestly didn't have high hopes for this show as, although I'm a huge fan of Bryan Cranston for his work on Malcolm In The Middle, I struggled to believe he could pull off such a train wreck of a character. The family is a typical middle class American family struggling to take care of their disabled son trying to make him have as normal a life as possible. In a way I can relate to the situation as I'm disabled myself and know how much of a strain it can be on parents. Sure, it's not the same disability, but the family struggling through it is definitely displayed well and R.J. Mitte as Walter Jr. is an excellent fit. Although I'm betting he was only cast because he too has Cerebral Palsy, he still fits the bill and plays the character brilliantly.Fantastic, fantastic show. I don't want to tell you much about the seasons events as it is quite short and risks spoiling certain events. I have to tell you that there are times in which this show doesn't hold back. It has no qualms about showing you the brutality of a broken man fighting against his own sense of morality, joining the drug world and even dealing with the fact that he killed a guy. Oh and obviously he's dying and is reminded of that from time to time but it's certainly gelled together brilliantly.Just to wrap it up I can only really say this TV show is amazing in every way and I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.

Amith (kndy)", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "Dark, gripping and unique!Emmy Award winner Bryan Cranston plays the role of Walter White, a chemistry teacher at a local high school trying make ends meet for his family. His wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) is pregnant and his son Walter White Jr. (RJ Mitte) is physically challenged.  The family are struggling financially and behind on bills.Walter tries to provide for his family by working two jobs.  He is a very intelligent chemist that can probably work anywhere and make a lot of money but yet he teaches chemistry to high school students (who have no care in chemistry) and then having to work part time at a car wash in which his students mock him for it.  To make matters worse, Walter has just discovered that he has inoperable lung cancer.Knowing that his family has no money, he doesn't tell his family about it.  In fact, he keeps the cancer to himself and with all the crap going in his life, this is the last thing he needs.Depressed and just out of it, he is surprised that his wife has a surprise 50th birthday party with all his friends and his family (with their friends).  He watches his sister-in-law Marie's boyfriend Hank (Dean Norris) is a DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) agent on television and how he goes after the notorious drug dealers in New Mexico and has been successful. Always finding a way to poke fun at Walter's weakness, he offers Walter a chance to go on a DEA ride-along as they go after drug dealers.  But what catches Walter's eye is the discussion of how much money is made by these drug dealers.So, Walter decides one day to take on Hank's offer to  go on a ride along for a crystal meth bust.  He sees how chemistry is applied to crystal meth, how it's developed in their labs and how these drug dealers are making really crappy products.  With basic chemistry, he can cook the finest crystal meth and possibly make some money for him and his family.So, during the bust, he sees a former student named Jesse Pinkman escaping from the area of the drug bust.  Walter goes to Jesse's residence after the busts and tells him that he wants to join forces with him.  He'll create the best crystal meth using his intelligent chemist skills and Jesse finds a way to make money.In an unlikely collaboration, both Walter and Jesse begin to work with each other.  But because Walter's crystal meth is perfect, Jesse's distributor want to know who's cooking it.  Thus they go to where Walter is cooking and threaten the both of them. In trouble, Walter uses his chemistry skills to create a cloud of poison and thus killing the drug dealers.Caught up in a botched up drug deal, both Walter and Jesse have now crossed the line and now have murdered one and keeping the other captive in the basement of Jesse's home.Walter goes from a ho-hum life to a criminal life involving drugs, theft and murder.  And because he needs money badly, he gets him and Jesse farther into criminal territory with ruthless drug dealers.  Meanwhile, his sister-in-law's DEA boyfriend is on the hunt for the person creating the perfect crystal meth.The first season of \"BREAKING BAD\" features a total of seven episodes.

Enjoyable and showing the wit of Cranston and the cast joking of how Cranston likes to be pants-less.  Interview with the cast and crew.

Discussions of television series versus films and more.  An intelligent discussion among professionals.* Screen Tests - The actual screen tests for Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris.* Breaking Bad on AMC - The AMC commercial for \"Breaking Bad\"JUDGMENT CALL:What an excellent series \"BREAKING BAD\" turned out to be.  I was really impressed by the Vince Gilligan's writing and the talent of Bryan Cranston (who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for \"BREAKING BAD\") in such a demanding role.I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant about watching the series because I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch a television series that may glorify crystal meth and it's good to know that the series doesn't.In fact, it's more about a television series about a very intelligent man making a very stupid decision that will eventually take him to the lowest of lows in order to make money for his family and his treatment.It's so shocking that Walter H. White forgoes working at a great company in order to utilize his talent towards creating crystal meth and getting him involved with the unthinkable and commiting certain heinous acts that you are just shocked.And that is what is so impressive with \"BREAKING BAD\" is that it's a series that is well-written, smart but dark, shocking and even disturbing at times.  And what helps break from the typical dark and depressing storylines is the other characters and the chemistry these characters have with the main character of Walter White.Anna Gunn as Skyler White, a loving wife, mother and sister other does an excellent job of playing a character with so many layers.  In one scene, she may be the concerned housewife and then another scene, the sultry wife who wants to make love to her husband.Then you have Walter's chemistry with the drug dealer Jesse.  Two unlikely people who would never be together in society but now having to work with each other in making money and despite the viewer feeling empathy for Walter because of his health condition and trying to make ends meet for his family, you can foresee nothing but darkness as both Walter and Jesse continue the downward spiral of working in the criminal underground.You see Walter eventually understanding that he put himself in a terrible position.  Having to work with unstable drug dealers, watching Jesse getting beaten and bloodied and even these two having to get involved in various criminal activities.This is not a television series glorifying drugs, it's a series that shows the seedy, dark and gritty criminal underground and things are not all rosy.  I was shocked about the developments that happen in the series which I rather not spoil for the viewer but you have to watch and see for yourself.  Definitely many twists and turns in this television series.Overall, \"BREAKING BAD\" is a unique, well-written and well-acted television series.  Surprisingly, AMC of all cable networks to showcase two exceptional dramatic series (the other is \"MADMEN\") is impressive and you can only think of how far this series will go.  The first season for \"BREAKING BAD\" really was surprising, entertaining and unique.  I was very impressed and looking back, I'm still quite shocked about a few certain scenes.An excellent television series thus far and I look forward in the upcoming twists and turns for the second season.  \"BREAKING BAD - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON\" is definitely recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Dark, gripping and unique!

It makes me depressed. I think the differene is, that my mom has always lived in the cozyness of the middle class so all this is new to her and frankly very far removed from reality as she knows it. I have on the other hand lived in poor neighborhoods most of my adult life. I have seen metheads, crackheads, tweakers, junkies, you name it and dealers on daily basis, the havoc it rages on whole communities. I have lived with this violence and seen it with a completely sober mind.When you live in a place like that, the saying goes \"that these people are quite the characters, but have no character\". When you live with this you develope a strange mixed feeling of empathy and disgust for people in the drug culture. Sometimes you just become num. I remember one time, walking on my way home an involuntary thought struck my mind as I passed some crackheads smoking, to my shame it was \"human garbage\". I was instantly horrified of how desensitized I had become toward my fellow human beings. The hard part is, that you get to know these people personally the longer you live among them so they are not just some strangers anymore. You run into them all the time. The dealers are not without a respect altogether, because when a new one comes around they say \"No she's not like that, leave her alone\".  Sometimes they laugh cuz the new guy mistook a  \"strait\" person for a customer. However you always have to let them know you are cool so it's a better choise to let them know you a little, that you don't judge them, so they will trust you and leave you alone. Neighborhoods like that are very dangerous and you don't want enemies.I know all the scum bags, the little guys that are trying to make a buck selling dope, the corrupt cops, or more like the cops who are so sick of it, they don't want to deal with it. Sometimes they can't do anything because the jails are full. Seriously.  The sadness and ramifications meth brings are horrific. The ignored children. I have seen it all and some of the people in the show are quite real to me. I know all of these characters. I know for example, its supposed to be funny that they are cooking meth in the basement while the realtor is showing the house, but to me it's not funny at all because it's too linked to what I have seen in reality and its anything but funny. I think the 1st season was more than enough addition to my reality. I highly doubt that I will watch any more of it. Sorry mom, you and my niece can keep talking about it, I am not interested.I guess if I was a straight laced and pampered in a way where I've never lived with this kind of reality I would find this funny and interesting.

All of the seasons of BrBa are great, but they all sort of drag out what's going on, and while the tension and suspense are there I still have a hard time remembering each episode because a lot of them left me with blue balls. This season however short it is, moved at a lightning quick pace and barely gave me time to adjust my face.Breaking Bad's first season shows the beginning of Walt's transformation from unlucky high school chemist to criminal mastermind, and it's all fascinating because it's all circumstantial, Walt's almost forced into this new dangerous world because the other options are die and leave his family with nothing, and that's what makes BrBa different from say, Scarface since Tony was just a greedy thug in the first place, Walt is a family man.Basically season 1 chronicles Walt taking out his competition early on in New Mexico, and there are many memorable scenes and results from it, one of my favorite moments is Walter putting a plate back together and making a horrible discovery, you know the one. But pretty much episode after episode some new variable changes the game completely, keeping the whole season short and sweet; television writers take note.If you haven't seen BrBa before and are curious you need to stop reading this right now and get your hands on the whole series, season 1 especially starts out the show with a bang but by season 3 it starts to show it's stretch marks.

In a desperate attempt to provide financial security for his family, the chemistry teacher joins forces with a former student Jesse to make the best quality meth lab around.This is a very stylized story driven by the number of odd and quirky characters that surround Walter. His pregnant wife Skyler knows Walter has a secret but what could it be? Add in Walter's streetwise brother-in-law who is a DEA agent, and there is quite a story here.Jesse, the low level drug dealer, and conservative and proper Walter become allies and unwilling friends in a world of violence and murder. Somehow a story about two drug dealers becomes a fascinating study of human nature and a fight between good and bad. Meth dealers as heroes of a show? Somehow it works mainly because we only see the \"bad\" guys in this scenario - not the addicted buyers of the meth.Be ready for a high level of violence. Somehow Walter and Jesse stay ahead of the law and fellow drug dealers. A simple idea to make money becomes a life-threatening career that probably can only end in disaster and destruction.The writing is incredible as we follow the twists and turns of Walter's life. The obvious is never what it seems and somehow we believe it all and crave for more.Cranston is at his absolute best as the cancer-striken chemistry teacher in for the fight of his life on many levels.

Until recently all I knew about the show was that it involved meth, starred Bryan Cranston, and was highly acclaimed. I don't watch too many television shows, but I questioned how a channel like AMC would be able to pull off this kind of material effectively. As you likely know, these questions are unwarranted. It's difficult to review the seven episodes that make up the first season without taking the brilliant second season that followed it into account. I believe this is why the first season is held in such high regard now and I think the reviews tend to reflect one's opinion of the show as a whole rather than this specific group of episodes. Because it's the first season and it was cut short by the writer's strike (from nine to seven episodes), the first season of Breaking Bad isn't as compelling as the season that followed it. This is not due to lower production values or weaker writing, merely the amount of exposition it takes to set up a series and the way Breaking Bad carefully establishes its characters. Perhaps this is biased itself as I'm judging this season based on how great the following season was. However, in regards to these seven episodes; the first three intrigued me, the fourth and fifth served as appropriate dramatic segues, and the final two episodes are nothing short of astounding. The show is undeniably a masterwork, but the first season sets up the masterpiece; it isn't one itself.At this point it seems superfluous to provide a synopsis, but it helps provide context. Walter White (Cranston) is a high school chemistry teacher, with a second job at a car wash, living with his pregnant wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and their disabled son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). Shortly after his 50th birthday he's diagnosed with stage-three terminal lung cancer. With no health insurance and stress piling up, he keeps his diagnosis secret from his family. With the financial burden weighing on him, Walt begins looking for a way to make money when his DEA agent brother-in-law Hank (Dean Norris) mentions how lucrative cooking meth can be. By chance, Walt notices Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), a former student of his, sneaking out of a house that Hank has busted. Walt's extensive knowledge of chemistry makes him able to cook highly potent meth and he blackmails Jesse into assisting him in the cooking and distribution. Shortly into Walt's newfound career, things go awry. I should add; this all happens in the pilot episode, which works like a self-contained movie. It's an impressive introduction.The second episode amps up the excitement with a shocking story arc that comes to a dramatic conclusion in the third episode. The fourth and fifth episodes are, as I mentioned, dramatic segues that put the focus on the characters and give them the depth necessary for us to start to care about them. These episodes are the least compelling, but they provide some of the most powerful dramatic moments of the season. The sixth episode debuts bald Walter, the look of the character that has become iconic as well as introducing Tuco (Raymond Cruz), the psychotic and powerful drug distributor with the power to lead Walter and Jesse to a big payday.The last two episodes are so intensely well-written and well-acted they immediately elevate the series. Each episode seems to improve upon the previous one and every creative decision that goes into forming the framework of the show is a success. A lot happens in only seven episodes, and every new character, every new conflict, seems inspired. The season ends on a high-note, opting to point the series in an intriguing direction rather than ending on a cheap cliffhanger. There's a real confidence in the direction of this series and the way it is put together.If the first season is slightly less than perfect, it's only because of necessary exposition. Every event here provides the catalyst for the rest of the series. Every episode of season one gets more intriguing and suspenseful; with season two, it only gets better.So what makes it so good? Well, you never get the impression that you're watching a television show. The cinematography, the pacing, the acting, the dialogue, the look, the feel of the show make Breaking Bad simply feel like a long movie. Bryan Cranston is a phenomenal actor who finally got people to take notice with this role and had this been a movie his work would be Oscar worthy. Aaron Paul also gives a terrific performance, one that takes a few episodes to grow on you and the love-hate chemistry he shares with Cranston is palpable.AMC is not HBO and there are FCC regulations, yet nothing about the content of the show ever feels restrained. There's violence, language, and sex; yet it's done tastefully and it works. This whole review is ultimately superfluous as I'm sure anyone reading it has already started watching the series. However, I must add to the pile of acclaim; this is one of the best shows on television and the first season is a special and unique introduction to it. Friends of mine had tried to convince me to watch this show for some time and I put it off. Don't make the same mistake. This show is almost as addictive as the drug it's based around and, similarly, it only gets more addictive the further in you go.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Strong Beginning to One of the Best Shows on Television", "unixReviewTime": 1343260800, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2012"},

A mild mannered high school chemistry teacher, he just turns 50 as the show starts. His wife is expecting another child, his first some is a well adjusted 16 year old with cp and life for Walter is just, well boring.Walter's job doesn't hold the glamour for him that it did when he began. After years of teaching (or at least trying to teach) kids chemistry and trying to pass along his passion for this knowledge, he now faces a generation that more so than the rest just doesn't care or take an interest. His second job working at a car wash results in an extra income but more degradation as the owner routinely disrespects him and has him do menial jobs.The worst finally comes around when Walter collapses at the car wash and is rushed to the hospital. Not informing his family, Walter is told by the doctors there that he has terminal, inoperable lung cancer. Where does one go when their entire world collapses around them?For Walter it comes in the form of his brother-in-law, a tough talking jovial DEA agent named Hank (Dean Norris). Cajoled by Hank time and again, he takes him up on his offer to go on a ride along when then next meth lab bust takes place. There is method to Walter's madness here. He wants to get a glimpse of the set up being used with plans of making meth on his own to sell and make a fortune that he can then leave his family. Fate steps in as Walter sees a young man escape from the house next door and recognizes him as Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), an ex-student of his.Walter tracks down Jesse and offers him a proposition. He wants to be the chemist involved in making the meth that Jesse would then in turn distribute. A straight business deal that would yield them both a nice wad of cash. To do so they need a place to cook and with the DEA seeking out houses being used, Walter comes up with a plan. A Winnebago, a meth lab on wheels.They get set up, make their first batch and Jesse is stunned by the purity of the product. Walter gets in a poke at Jesse concerning his ability to listen and learn, something he didn't seem to do in high school. Had he done so in chemistry class, he would have learned the tools he needed to become a major drug provider.So here we have the set up. This is a true anti-hero if there ever was one. A mild mannered suburbanite turned into a major drug dealer? Yes this is the basis for the series. But don't misunderstand. It doesn't glorify the drug culture or Walter's decision to create drugs. The story more involves Walter's attempt to do a good deed in providing for his family but at the same time making decisions that place himself and them in jeopardy. It's more about living with your wrong decisions and watching as Walter and Jesse attempt to save themselves from the decisions they made.As the series progresses (only 7 episodes) we watch as Walter comes to life. Perhaps it's the sense of danger, perhaps the fact that he is living outside of his comfort zone or perhaps it's that he is facing death by cancer that has made Walter change. We see him move from mild mannered chemistry teacher to a man willing to walk into the home base of a wild and jacked up drug dealer to demand respect and money.But the series isn't just about that. It's also about his wife and her love of her husband as she tries to understand his change, not knowing until halfway through the series that he has cancer. It's about his son dealing not only with his own problems but with a father he loves but hasn't quite learned to respect. It's about a man driven so far to the edge that he gets involved with drug manufacturing even though his brother-in-law is a DEA agent. It's about a man who when faced with what he feels are no options, turns to the darkest part of his soul. It's about life as we probably all wish we never have to experience.The series is not just a hard edged drama though. Throughout the escapades of Walter and Jesse we get plenty of actual laughs. Whether it's Walter standing in the middle of a road in his tighty whiteys with a gun he doesn't know how to use or Walter grabbing his wife's thigh in the midst of a PTA meeting, there are some truly funny moments.When I first heard of this show it didn't interest me, it didn't sound like something I'd like. The more I watched it on DVD though, the more invested in these characters I became. I liked Walter but not what he did. I felt for Jesse but wished he seek treatment. And I hoped that this family would find a way to survive everything that happened to them.It might not be the cup of tea that the average renter would enjoy. But the dark humor, the danger and the interest in the main character make this compelling viewing as it progresses. Cranston and Paul do a fantastic job as an odd couple for the current state of affairs. And once the series ends, you find yourself looking forward to season two (coming out on DVD soon as well as season 3 starting on AMC in March 2010).One thing that has to be mentioned again about this series. It's the story of a man who produces crystal meth. It would be easy to write the series off as an homage to meth dealers and manufacturers. But that isn't at its root what the story is about. It's about a man who makes the wrong decisions for the right reasons and then has to face the consequences. Movie makers have made films about bad guys doing bad things for years and yet we've found ourselves both enjoying the films and rooting at times for the bad guys (think BONNIE AND CLYE, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and possibly even Hannibal Lecter when he snacked on characters we learned to hate).My biggest fear with this series is that it will become the norm. With series like WEEDS where a recently widowed mother becomes a major marijuana dealer or DEXTER where a serial killer becomes a hero for killing bad guys and other serial killers, a trend seems to be starting. And with Hollywood being a place that loves to imitate or repeat past successes with poor quality knock offs, this could turn out to be just the first of many shows like this. Let's just hope that they know it's good and don't move forward with plans on shows about loveable hit men, goofy corrupt politicians or silly next door neighbor pedophiles.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "SO BAD IT'S GOOD", "unixReviewTime": 1268524800, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2010"},

At first  I was reluctant, not wanting even to watch episode one, season one, of this series. In spite of my reluctance, the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends, and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests. I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting, of the film (filmed in 35 mm film), but also on the strength of the story itself.Walter White, the protagonist of the series, is a high school, genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After being told that the cancer was inoperable, and sneaking a peek into his bank account, he realizes his financial situation isn't healthy at all, worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. S*** truly hit the fan for Mr. White. With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment, Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed. His brother-in-law, a DEA agent, spoils hims by saying a meth-cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine. Being a chemistry genius, he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect, purest recipe for cooking meth. He wouldn't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business. He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth-lab and living his normal parallel life.At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the \"righteous\" act of providing for his family's future when it meant going to the dark-side of money-making by not selling, but actually making the drugs: cooking meth (a.k.a crystal meth, ice, clouds, crystal, glass, tik, catch my drift?). It felt wrong but somehow, the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.Molecular visuals of METH.Did you know that meth has a medical use? It's used for ADHD, narcolepsy, and treatment-resistant depression.After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there, \"the blue stuff\", Walter and Jesse (his partner, a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth-cook) found trench after trench, failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product, which albeit highly addictive, always seemed to fall into the wrong hands. Fail after epic-fail, they found themselves delving into the dark-world of selling drugs, not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path. They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius-formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord, a strategy they would eventually regret.For me the series has been very enjoyable, with more than just a great story-line and more than just action-and-adventure psychological excitement. Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series: How a man in search of a path, once thought righteous and bittersweet, found that he, in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark-side, embraced them--the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth. How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor, Brian Cranston, winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.In parallel with Walter's charter development, I also admire Jesse Pinkman's (Aaron Paul) devolution into a darker creature, more menacing, less tolerant and much less merciful. If he started out as a meth-head, he slowly turned into an character of many layers, of half-patched hidden depths. After having suffered beatings, the death of his true-love, and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face, Pinkman becomes a man to fear, a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.At the beginning of each episode, I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each, but hell, the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it, you're lured into its mind-gripping world; you can't just shake it off. You'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes, divided in two parts.

The further he goes to try and provide for his family the darker and more complicated his life becomes with crazy drug dealer's, increasing extended family issues with his wife's sister, Marie, and to top it off a bother in law, Hank, who is a Drug Enforcement Administration Officer.The episodes found on this set are:Ep 1: Pilot - Walter White is a high school chemistry teacher who learns that he has lung cancer.

I've been extremely impressed by what I've seen so far, and consider all that I've seen so far to be first rate.  While I'm not yet convinced that this is going to end up a truly great series, it clearly has enormous potential and is buoyed by several exceptional performances, especially by Bryan Cranston as Walter White.Just about everything that has taken place so far on the show has been beyond criticism.  My hesitation in proclaiming this a masterpiece or even one of the best shows currently on television stems from a lack of sense what the endgame of the show is.  Only time will eliminate my hesitancy.  If it turns out that Vince Gilligan has a clear vision of where this show will eventually end up and if that vision is compelling, then this will indeed go down as a great series.  Does Gilligan have a rough storyboard for the entire series?  Or does he just have a rough idea of where the next season is going?  It is an important distinction.  Although Ron Moore repeatedly hinted that he had only a few ideas of where he was taking BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, the ending and the way it deeply coheres with so much that happened even in the first couple of seasons leads me to believe that he was essentially deceiving us and really knew all along.  Contrast this with a series that was just making it up as it went along, THE X-FILES (a series upon which Gilligan worked extensively).  Although there were many great episodes on that show and a host of memorable aspects, in the end it was a show that was greatly harmed by the ramshackle long story arc, with a host of variant versions of key events (e.g., what precisely happened to Mulder's sister and who his father was, answers to which changed several times over the course of the show).  We simply haven't had enough episodes of BREAKING BAD for us to tell whether there is an end towards which everything is pointing.That being said, there are a number of things I really love about this show.  Sticking with narrative structure for the moment, I like that many of the episodes more or less pick up from the end of the previous episode.  I'm a passionate believer in the superiority of serial narrative.  Almost without exception all the TV series that I have loved over the course of the past twenty years have featured serial narratives; virtually none have been episodic.  I love the complexity of character and story that can result from this.  And BREAKING BAD clearly has embraced the serial format.  This will, in the end, be a series with a definite beginning, middle, and end.I also have been blown away -- along with everyone else -- by Bryan Cranston as Walter White.  He was good in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, but he is so much better in this it is as if Jerry Seinfeld had gone to sleep and work up Laurence Olivier.  The range and depth of his performance is absolutely astonishing.  I especially love how nuanced he makes Walter.  Although someone engaged in criminal activity, he does so from a sense of moral obligation.  He is pursuing immoral means to achieve a moral end.  Above all he is a man dedicated to caring for his family.  At no point is this illustrated more than in the moment where he compiles a list of the reasons for sparing and the reasons for killing Crazy Eight, a drug dealer being held in his partner's basement.  In the \"not to kill\" column he has a long, long list of compelling reasons.  In the \"kill\" column, there is only one:  if he lets him go he will kill both him and his family.  That pretty much sums up Walter.  He will do no wrong, unless by so doing he endangers his family.Another thing I love about the show is the wide range of responses it evokes.  Although essentially a drama, I find myself laughing constantly.  His life has been reduced to one long absurdity, and Gilligan does not hesitate to emphasize this by showing how ridiculous things are.  But the show can turn on on a dime to go from humorous or dramatic, to out and out shocking.  There are many, many OMG! moments one the show.This has become one of the shows that I simply won't miss.  No one who cares about quality television should neglect catching up on this one ASAP.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A promising series with considerable potential", "unixReviewTime": 1238025600, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2009"},

The show is centered on High School chemistry teacher, Walter White (Bryan Cranston), who discovers he's dying from cancer. Determined not to leave his family with nothing, White teams up with his former student and local drug dealer, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) in an attempt to process and sell crystal meth. Producing the drug isn't the hard part, it's distributing it while staying out of trouble. That's easier said than done, especially when your wife is on your case 24/7, and your brother in-law is a DEA agent.This show is terrific and worth every second I've spent watching it, but I almost missed out. The pilot episode was not a strong one, in fact, many fans of the show have called it the worst episode of the entire series. If you can make it passed that, the first season isn't much better. The first season is extremely dark and depressing, focusing mainly on Walt's illness and the effect it has on his family. It really wasn't easy to watch, especially if you've like me, and have had family go through the same thing.The good news is that after the depressing 7 episode first season, the show gets much much better. The network or the producers had to have to seen the same thing that everyone saw and the attention of future episodes is centered around Walt and Jesse's growing business and the problems they have, including nosy family members, the DEA, seedy people looking for a taste, and of course rival dealers and gangs. The show really picks up in the second season and starts to evolve into the award winning crime drama it has become.Bryan Cranston plays Walt and how good is he? He has won 3 Emmy's, and has been nominated every season the show has been on. The man he plays is so complicated that you really needed the very best actor you could find to play him. Walt White is a mess of emotions, concealed within a strong persona, it's this concealment that also helps to keep his conscience at bay, most of the time.Jesse Pinkman is played by Aaron Paul who is also very good. Paul himself has been nominated for four Emmy's, winning twice, and will now and forever be required to call people bitch. Paul is a very good actor and does a great job playing a character who I find to be extremely annoying. Jesse is always managing to !@#$ thing up, he's always putting them at risk by saying stupid things and doing stupid things. To be honest with you, I don't care much for the character, but the fact that the character, as opposed to the actor, annoys me, shows how strong his performances is.Walt's family is also a main stay in the show, his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn), is as strong a housewife as I have ever seen. There is nothing Skyler White won't say and she is often Walt's morale compass, albeit one that is remarkably nosy and unappreciative. His son is played by newcomer R.J. Mitte whose  handicapped angle is actually real. Mitte was born with cerebral palsy, which effects his speech and movements. He admits that he over-dramatizes the effects for the show, but he is still handicapped in real life and one hell of an inspirational person. Through it all he has never let anyone tell him he can't do anything and he has been open and upfront about his condition to anyone who has asked him about it. He's really an inspiration kid, who took a handicapped and used it to his advantage.Finally, Walt's brother-in-law, DEA Agent, Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), brings much needed comic relief to a show that can be hard to watch sometimes. Besides being a great cop, Schrader has a personality that is larger than life. Even in the context of a show, where the cops are the bad guys, you find yourself drawn to Schrader and rooting him on.Breaking Bad has won a total of 7 Emmy Awards and is one of the highest rated shows in cable history. The show most defiantly fits into the category of addictive television, but unlike it's neighboring show, The Walking Dead. The acting is as believable as it gets and the story just gets better and better every season. If you can make it through the slow and depressing first season, you will find an unbelievable show that may very well be one of the best that cable has ever seen.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]", "unixReviewTime": 1377216000, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2013"},

In this second season, the claustrophobia of Season One gives way to paranoia as the town of Jericho is taken over by a provisional Federal government based in Nebraska. As it turns out, this new government is the result of a political conspiracy, and the citizens of Jericho, like Kansans in the 1850s and '60s, are caught in the middle of a chilling civil war.The ensemble acting of the first season is replaced by a fast-moving, plot-heavy political narrative over which contemporary (Iraq War-era) politics cast a long shadow. The new government installs a Halliburton-like mega-corporation in charge of all economic activity in the town; this company also owns a private, mercenary security force (ala Blackwater) which terrorizes the locals. Finally, the townspeople have to take a stand: are they going to knuckle under to a powerful, remote dictatorship, or will the spirit of 1776 survive?  Action junkies and fans of political conspiracy-theory films will dig this.  Although it may feel a little rushed, this short season (only seven episodes were made) ties up most of the loose ends, and should satisfy most fans.  Fun stuff, and a little scary, too.

He manages to to find refuge in an underground strip club, which has also been deemed illegal by the government of the future.

She continues to dance and the odd thing is...the customers love it. Zombie strippers are the new sex appeal. As the money piles up, so do the victims. Will the chemo-virus continue to spread and if so...how will it be contained?First of all, don't be confused. This is movie is one of the cheesiest films ever. I almost turned it off several times and I honestly can't tell you why I'm reviewing this thing. The sad thing is it's like a trainwreck in slow motion.

Not that you really care, but you wonder whose really deemed worthy of surviving said trainwreck. It is ludicrous, ridiculous, and absurd...but it's amusing as hell.How ridiculous is it? Let's see...strippers being turned into zombies and becoming super strippers, zombies being sexy, having the most stereotypical Mexican janitor...ever, the casts biggest names being Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund, special effects you'd find in Xena: Warrior Princess, a Christian stripping for her nanna, Jenna Jameson shooting ping pong balls and pool balls out her...well...I'll let you see that for yourself, angry dragons, and foamy chewbaccas...the list goes on and on. I'm sure I missed so many more. The sad thing is that despite being the cheesiest of cheese and being as bad as it is, there's still a few good things buried under the cheese.

The most obvious being that there's a lot of nudity in this, which is good because it'll probably be one of the only things that'll keep anyone watching. Robert Englund's over the top performance as the germophobic strip club owner is pretty memorable. Also, the make-up effects are surprisingly good at times. The special effects are horrid, but the make-up is actually better than you think it'd be.In a film as ridiculously cheesy as this, I can't blame anyone if they turn it off before it reaches the half hour mark. The thing is though if you stick with it, it's actually enjoyable because it's so bad. It's cheesy, it's amusing, the acting is so bad that you'll be quoting it for days, the plot is pointless, and it even has a weak attempt at a twist in the ending!

Turns out it's in the horror-parody genre, most reminiscent of \"Return of the Living Dead\" (the first one, not #2 or #3) which was an amazingly enjoyable film to watch.  A couple decades later, this film has similarities in its tone and in the sheer fun it has with the zombie genre.  It definitely pays homage to scenes from a number of previous zombie films.  It has a linear plot: virus in a secret govt. research facility escapes, infecting strippers in an off-site illegal strip club, and things go from bad to worse.  However it has a decidedly comedic tone to the entire film.  It used as a source material a French play about \"The Rhinoceros\" (a gentleman's nightclub), hence all the references to French and European existentialist philosophers, writers etc.  In what other film would you get a stripper quoting Nietzche, or a spec ops guy named Camus?  It also pokes fun (repeatedly) at the George W. Bush administration-be forewarned- and it deliberately overplays stereotypes like the \"crack special forces\", the for-profit corporate contractors, the East European Madame, the greedy but inept nightclub owner,and so on.  It's not really very scary, but there's quite a bit of blood and special effects depicting violence at times.  And the \"stripper\" actresses are quite good.  They do make some beautiful stripper- dancers.  There is female nudity in the film.There are a few holes in the plot but it's all meant to be fun, so you can't take the plot all that seriously anyhow.Bonuses to the DVD include a whole bunch of trailers for other films, quite a few cut scenes (some pretty interesting), commentary filmtrack, and two fairly short clips on the making of the film.

The plot of this whole movie is pretty weak, a group of the best of the best army group, which consist of 3 emo dorks with guns, a moron who likes to lick knives, a pretty wimpy looking guy trying to be a bad mofo'n leader... oh, and a Paris Hilton wanna-be all go into a facility that a zombie outbreak has leaked out in and they gotta go in and shoot all the zombies.... something goes wrong, one of the emo soldiers is bitten, and instead of getting his brains blown out, he escapes to a strip club that is supposed to be illegal (what was illegal about it?) and like any person bitten by zombies, he becomes one, then attacks the star of the strip club and she becomes a zombie too. The club owner (Englund) doesn't mind that his new zombie girl goes out & strips, then takes a victim backstage and doesn't just take tips, but eats them too, as well as converting the rest of the strippers into zombies along the way. As long as it's making him some money, it's ok with him... until it all gets out of control.Describing that made it sound like the plot is a bit more then I thought, but it's not really. The army group have got to be the most unconvincing army persona ever assembled, to believe those D&D; grand masters survived military is a joke in itself... but this film wasn't going for realism, just stupidity and humor.So I haven't really said anything positive about the film, the acting and plot are not much, so why let it slide with 3 stars? Well, as I said, it's not boring, it is watchable, and fairly entertaining for a humor that is something like a Troma film, but with a bigger budget.I probably would have only given it 2 stars, maybe 2 and a half, but there was one scene in this movie that I was laughing hysterically at... it's a scene between two of the zombie strippers having a shoot out to see who's the better zombie, and the typical ping pong ball trick comes into play, but you'll have to see for yourself how it's played out, and what happens next... it's too ridicules to not find funny. So that scene alone I gave an extra star to.And then there is the make up and puppet fx that are actually very convincing and a lot better then you would expect. I was impressed hearing that things like the decapitated head was actually a puppet, or mechanical head rather then a real actors head with his body removed later with CGI or something.For the pervs, yes there is plenty of skin to see, provided you like skinny, bony-looking women with implants, which i found to be about as un-erotic as the zombie strippers decaying bodies through the films.... actually, i think they looked better as zombies... anyway, the end really spoils the movie when the worlds dumbest army troups come back into the movie to give the worlds most confusing ending that partly makes little sense, but leaves you wondering, WTF WAS THAT ABOUT??? then you re-cap the film and think, WTF?????? and i'm sitting here typing this review still thinking, WTF WAS THAT???????", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "WTF Did I just witness???", "unixReviewTime": 1230508800, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2008"},

The abandoned lighthouse on the cliff not far away no longer shines a beacon. The cave below and the sandy beach still receive the incoming tide. Be wary. Laura Sanchez grew up in the orphanage. When she was about seven she was adopted and left. Now she is 37, married to Carlos, and they are parents to a little boy, Simon, about seven. They adopted Simon, who doesn't know this, and who is deadly ill with a disease only pills can keep at bay. Now Laura and Carlos have just bought the abandoned orphanage and are moving in. It is a large building of many rooms and hallways, with dark oak paneling, old fire places and frosted, etched glass. They hope to make it a home for children with special needs. There are no children yet, just Simon.Simon makes friends, make-believe friends. They tell him things, he says. \"I won't grow old. I'm not going to grow up,\" he tells his mother. \"Will you be like Peter Pan?\" Laura asks. \"Like my new friends,\" Simon says. \"There's more than one?\" \"Six.\" \"They won't grow up either?\" Laura asks. Simon looks at her. \"They can't,\" he saysSimon leads Laura in a game to discover clues, a game he and his friends have invented. Suddenly the game is foreboding. \"You're not my mother!\" Simon screams at Laura. \"Who told you that?\" she asks, stricken that this little boy, her son, is facing something she and her husband were waiting to tell him when he was older. \"My friend told me,\" Simon says. \"What friend?\" \"Tomas,\" Simon yells, crying and defiant. \"Tomas told me the truth, that I'm just like them.... I have no mother or father and I'm going to die.\"Days later, Simon disappears, apparently kidnapped. The parents, with Laura increasingly frantic, try everything to find him. In time, there will only be Laura and this moldering stone mansion where she was raised as an orphan with other orphans. We begin to learn what happened there when Laura as a child left.So...whose imagination, whose story are we inhabiting?\"Horror\" is a term that has been debased in the movies over the last thirty years or so. Technology and computers have eliminated most of the need for imagination and the kind of dread we make for ourselves out of little things. Market research drives so many creative decisions into the dead end of splatter and special effects. The Orphanage is just slightly a horror movie. It is lonely, deliberative, sad, thoughtful, even quiet, even, surprisingly, with a degree of contentment at the conclusion.All the actors do fine jobs, and there is a notably quiet and intense performance by Geraldine Chaplin as a psychic whose own death is near. It is Belen Rueda as Laura who helps make this movie something special. There are so many opportunities for intense \"acting,\" distraught \"acting,\" tearful \"acting.\" Rueda does nothing of this. We believe her as Laura because she doesn't try to over-dramatize Laura. Laura is often intense and sometimes distraught. She also puzzles through this mystery, is determined to find her son and can take action. But Rueda never overacts. Thanks to Rueda's performance and fine directing and screenwriting, I think The Orphanage establishes itself as an unusual and intriguing movie.The audio and video transfers are very good. There are some typical \"How we made the movie\" extras.

That's not to say there haven't been good horror films in the past ten years, but there are only a handful and this one has to be close to the top. What sets this apart from other horror films is that it doesn't rely on cheap scares or CGI to try and scare the viewers. It's all about the atmosphere and it works so well. In general, I'm not a fan of horror films that are about ghosts. This seems to be on a whole different level though. It's also one of the more original horror films I've seen in quite awhile, which is quite a relief. I'm not sure about you, but I'm kind of sick of sitting through a movie and realizing it reminds me of this movie or this movie or it \"pays homage\" to three movies in one film. I'm not saying that influences are a bad thing, but originality is so hard to come by these days and I embrace it with open arms. It also seems like whatever movie Guillermo Del Toro is involved with can do no wrong, in my eyes. I know he only produced this film, but still. I've yet to see any movie with his name in the credits that I didn't love.I don't think this film is for everybody though. If you're looking for the next Ring or Grudge or if you're wanting blood spewing from amputated limbs, then you'll probably want to look elsewhere.

I'm talking about cover your eyes, look away, symbolic terror.  A woman wiping her face with what we know to be human ashes.  Creepy figures half-seen and then gone.  This is a film that gets under your skin.The plot is fairly simple: Laura moves into the orphanage where she grew up.  With her is her adopted son Simon and her husband Carlos.  Before moving into the Orphanage, Simon had two imaginary friends; after a day in the new place, he has six.  And then a strange old lady shows up...and then Simon goes missing.  Months pass, and eventually Laura feels compelled--against her husband's wishes--to seek help from beyond.The film plays with typical horror stereotypes: creepy old buildings; creepy little children; creepy old people.  What makes everything work here is director J.A. Bayona's understated style; he doesn't spell things out for us, he lets the tension--and character development--build, until we reach a gut-wrenching climax.  You can see it coming, of course; the problem with horror films these days is that there's not a lot that hasn't been done.  Thus, we must focus on HOW it is done; and in this regard, THE ORPHANAGE excels.The lead performances from Belen Rueda and Fernando Cayo are rock-solid; supporting roles--especially an incredibly spine-chilling turn from Geraldine Chaplin--are just as good.  In case you're wondering: Guillermo Del Toro's presence is felt, but only in an off-hand way.  Some scenes are so horrifically beautiful, one can't help but be completely awed.

In other words, a four or five star horror film is probably not the same as a four or five star drama in most cases.  The Orphanage really is a four star movie because it is more than your typical horror fare.  Let's call it a supernatural thriller instead.

Years later and Laura decides to return by actually buying and living in the orphanage with her husband Carlos and her son Sim&oacute;n.  Sim&oacute;n makes several imaginary friends and the plot unfolds with a series of effective and believable twists and turns.

Laura (Belen Rueda) spent half of her childhood in an orphanage on Spain's coast, before she was adopted. As an adult, she returns to the enormous and beautiful home, long since fallen into disuse, with her physician husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and 7-year-old son Simon (Roger Princep). The couple intend to re-open the establishment as a home for disabled children. But Simon's temperament is becoming belligerent, and he is fast accumulating imaginary friends. Then he disappears without a trace.This is a ghost story, but, in spite of its supernatural elements, \"The Orphanage\" has a rigorous logic. I appreciated that, as horror films so often get sloppy with their narratives. The story is propelled forward by two strong emotions: fear of whatever lurks in the house and Laura's fierce maternal love. Laura takes the audience with her on frantic searches for clues, which give the film an action movie pace and emotional immediacy between the thoughtful lulls. At the halfway point, I thought the film lost its pacing and went off the rails until I realized that the film -and the audience's perception of it- pivots at that point. Then I was impressed by the well-conceived structure.Director J.A. Bayona, writer Sergio G. Sanchez, cinematographer Oscar Faura, and editor Elena Ruiz, amazingly, are all working on their first feature film. Bayona harkens back to the best years of Hollywood genre filmmaking by creating the orphanage completely on a soundstage. It's a stunning set and a wonderful character in the movie. They go easy on the score and try to tell the story visually as much as possible. Belen Rueda makes us feel her anguish, desperation, and fear at the loss of her son. \"The Orphanage\" is top-notch gothic horror, comparable to the best psychological thriller/horror films that have come out of Asia in recent years.

Not in any part. The acting, the direction, the scenery, the set design, the script, the music, the ending--it all worked together, all paid off.This starts off slowly, gently. But from the first images of children playing a game in the yard fronting a large, mansion-style orphanage--the shadows, the direction, the way the action of an innocent game is set up--perfectly sets the tone of the film. It's nostalgic, but it's also slightly creepy. It foreshadows a lot. Pay attention.Zoom years later. One of those children who'd been playing in the yard, the girl Laura, is now grown with a son. We find out the main characters--mother Laura, father, son Simon--have purchased the former orphanage and plan to set up a residence to care for special needs children. Simon, himself, is  a special needs child: He has HIV.Soon, the game of \"invisible friends\" takes on an ominous reality. And every scene builds tension, builds, builds, until we really are at the edge of our seat as this mother is thrown into the greatest nightmare of parents.The film then asks the question--of the lead and of the viewer--how far will a mother, this mother, go to find her missing son?While the conclusion felt inevitable and was pretty obvious quite early on (the clues are all there, and the script does not cheat), it's the HOW of getting to it that makes this all work. Almost all is fairly foreshadowed, but the small actions and words that lead us along to those conclusions can be easily missed if we focus on something that seems more emotional.I cannot describe how beautiful the finale--the climactic moment-- is. Tragedy, sorrow, redemption and beauty all coalesce. It is a miraculous cooperation of acting/direction/storytelling/setting/lighting and music that brings us to this moment of bittersweet magic.The denouement is lovely, too, leaving us with a feeling of what we lose as human beings, mortal beings, and what we can gain if there is more than mere matter.Tragedy redeemed--that's what I thought as I went to bed after seeing this.Yes, this is a ghost story that disturbs mightily, and the scares are surely present, but it is not a gore-show. It is a more human and artistic ghost story, and is in fact MORE than a ghost story. It's a story of family and friendship, and of a mother who will not give up, because the deepest love outlives the grave, even defeats the grave.You really need to see this film. Magnificent.

Indeed within the first 30 minutes I was feeling like it might be just that. I found that portion of the film to be pretty average noting along the way the superb acting and production values. But the film quickly gets much more atmospheric and fills its canvas with an unusally creepy and melodramtaic tone. The story s suprisingly unique even if there were moments that seemed like they could have been inspired by films like Poltergiest or The Others. As a solidly moody supernatural story this film ranks as one of the better ones I have seen. And there is plenty of good creepy scares and horror along the way. The film gets more intense as it goes along. I found this film to sometimes be a soild performer as horror films go. It was often indeed very creepy and made me squirm more than once, I foud my self biting my nails, which is something I havent done in a good long time at the movies. There was some subject matter here and there that seemed a little bit contrived and predictable, and the end was not much of a suprise, but mildly touching. Some members who reviewed this film commented that it made them cry. Im figuring they were refering to the end. But the end really didnt bring me to tears, and I love a good tear jerker the same as the next person. I agree though that it was rather touching at then end though.

But when the circle of his imaginary friends starts to grow, his worried parents arrange for the children's party in their new home that used to be an orphanage where Laura grew up before she herself was adopted.

It is at that point that we see what a true motherly love is.  It is also heartbreaking after we learn that Simon's desappearance and ultimately his death is partially her fault too.  I liked film's idea on how living family left behind has strong ties with people they were close to once, long gone.  Just as Laura has strong impressions of her son being around, so does Laura's husband about her presence once she is gone to another world.

The idea, the intention, is the creep out the viewer, to give the viewer pleasant chills.  It's the kind of movie that doesn't merely FEAR the afterlife, it accepts that ghosts can have their own motives that are just as worthy as the motives of living folks.THE ORPHANAGE comes from the current revival in the ghost story within Spanish cinema.  Fortunately, we haven't had to endure too many English language remakes (like we did with many of the misguided Americanizations of Japanese films recently).  We get to see the original films, in their original languages, with subtitles.  Although THE OTHERS was remade into English, a terrific film like THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is only viewable in Spanish right now.  That film is simply too steeped in Spanish history to be in any other language.THE ORPHANAGE takes place in a deserted old mansion that some 30 years prior had served as an orphanage.  The main character is returning with her adopted son and her physician husband to reopen the facility into a home for special needs children.  The mood of the movie is one of foreboding right from the start...how could this rundown, dusty old place every be an inviting home for anyone?  Sure enough, right away the young son Simon begins to \"see things\" and he quickly finds new \"imaginary\" friends that make him do things.  There is NOTHING new about this whatsoever, and for awhile, you might suspect you're in a clich&eacute; ridden story.Then comes opening day, when the new children arrive for a sort of welcoming party with their parents...and Simon disappears.  The frantic search of his mother scares off the prospective clients, and for the next bit of the movie, we see the mother's descent into obsession.  She is convinced she can find her son.  Further, she is convinced that some ghosts have taken him.Naturally, her husband doesn't believe her and neither do the police.  At one point, we have a GHOST HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL kind of scene, when a psychic comes to the house with her scientific crew.  (The psychic is played by Geraldine Chaplin...an unusual but effective casting choice.)  This crew kicks things into a higher gear...but they depart and eventually, mom is left on her own to unravel all the secrets she needs.I don't want to reveal much about the plot specifics, because part of the fun of these kinds of movies is figuring out just what the ghosts want and who they are.  The  movie builds to a fairly surprising plot revelation and finally to a bittersweet ending.  It's a combination of SIXTH SENSE, DARK WATER and POLTERGEIST.It's an artfully made film...very atmospheric.  There isn't much unusual about the story, the mood or the technical work...the filmmakers aren't breaking new ground.  But what this films DOES bring is a genuine feeling of sadness and a true glimpse at the bonds of mother and son...and even a mother to all children in need.  It's a well-acted film, with Bel&eacute;n Rueda really terrific as the mother, Laura.  She's in virtually every scene, and it's her actions, reactions and emotions that drive the film.  We experience in through her eyes.  She's a fragile woman who finds pretty large reserves of toughness when she needs to, and it's nearly as satisfying watching her character grow as it is to see how the plot resolves.This movie doesn't cover new ground or show us anything we haven't seen before.  But it's skillfully made with no irony, and it simply works.  It's a pleasurable ghost story indeed.One note on the \"R\" rating:  There is one \"F\" word.  Otherwise, I think it gets an R because so much of the death and jeopardy involves children.  I think the film is fine for anyone 14 and over.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An honest-to-goodness GHOST STORY!  Moody and effective.", "unixReviewTime": 1200182400, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2008"},

But then I got behind and didn't start writing this review for a week, and when I sat down to do so, I realized I'd forgotten a great deal of it. It took some serious brain-wracking and a consultation of a plot synopsis for me to start remembering scenes from the movie that had impressed me.Laura (Mar Adentro's Belen Rueda) moves back to her childhood home, an abandoned orphanage, looking to refurbish it and start a smaller, more intimate home for disabled children. She and her family aren't even settled in. however, when her autistic son finds himself some imaginary friend-- but just how imaginary are they, and what do they want with him? Distressed by this turn of events, Laura turns to paranormal investigators to find out what's going on.I think my problems with remembering the film have to do with my seeing Saint Ange last month, which riffs on many of the same themes and is, simply, a better and more memorable movie. Still, Bayona's first big-screen feature film does outdo a number of recent Spanish supernatural flicks that have made it over the Atlantic (viz, the awful Darkness). A second viewing reminded me what I liked about it the first time-- the acting is mostly solid, the atmosphere is well-done, the pacing and direction are both first-rate.

Zwick", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "\"The Orphanage\" offers proof positive that quality filmmaking can triumph over even the tritest of themes.  In bare outline, it's really just the oldie about the family that moves into a creepy older establishment - in this case an abandoned orphanage with a very dark past - only to be hounded by the spirits of the people who died there under horrific circumstances.  Laura (Belen Rueda) is a woman who was herself raised there as a child and who has now returned with her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), and their adopted son, Simon (Roger Princep), to open a home for disabled children.  In no time flat, however, things begin going bump in the night, and Simon disappears under mysterious circumstances.  Could the souls of the children who died there be trying to contact the living, and could they be using Simon as a means of achieving that end?Anyone with even the most rudimentary knowledge of how such stories normally play themselves out should have no trouble divining the answers to those questions.  But in his debut as a director, Juan Antonio Bayona demonstrates a real flair for the macabre, so that every haunted-house-movie clich&eacute; - every creaking door, every sudden apparition - that comes our way seems somehow new and fresh again.  Perhaps it's the artful imagery, the fluid camerawork, or the highly effective soundtrack - or all three combined - that account for the movie's effectiveness.  Whatever it is, Bayona is able to imbue even the most mundane object - a playground ride, a child's doll - with the utmost menace and dread.Bayona has clearly done his homework, for, at times, the film seems to be channeling some of the \"greats\" of the genre, namely \"The Innocents,\" \"The Omen,\" \"Poltergeist\" (especially with its high-tech ghost-hunters and creepy psychic played by Geraldine Chaplin), and the original version of \"The Haunting.\"  And because of the quality of the work here, the movie emerges more as an homage to those earlier classics than a slavish imitation of them.People may be divided over the story's resolution - finding it either immensely satisfying or unnecessarily corny - but no one can deny that, for genuine thrills and suspense, \"The Orphanage\" is one of the better horror movies of the past several years.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "top-notch Spanish horror film", "unixReviewTime": 1286928000, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2010"},

Just about every element of this movie was crafted with loving hands that put the finishing touches on each and every scene before you and I would ever see it.

The director worked magic with his cast and crew to bring this story to life from the beautiful orphanage remodeled into the families home. The cinematography was noting short of spectactular from inside the home to the beach and cave to the shots in town where the accident occurs. The mood was thick enough to cut with a knife and is so seldom seen in movies of this genre where mood can make or break a movie. The writer and director were able to turn words into this increadible work of visual and audio art. My only real issues with this movie is it seemed to drag a bit at times and the tension buildup was not always rewarding or paid off (ok we heard that but?). I would have liked to of seen more from the ghosts prespectives than was shown. I don't need tons of cgi or gore to make a story good, but I do need payment and thats where this looses a few points.

Quite frankly, we need it. Too many `horror' films are excuses for filmmakers to throw buckets of blood and gore at the screen, hurling everything at us in an attempt to see what sticks, or more appropriately, what makes us sick. Gone are the suspense and terror filmmakers like Hitchcock (\"Psycho\"), Robert Wise (\"The Haunting\") and John Carpenter (the original \"Halloween\") who created films with such skill, riveting us to our seats and scaring us away from showers, dark houses and babysitters. Now, `horror' films seem determined to use as many special effects as possible to recreate the goriest, most vial displays. How is this suspenseful or frightening? It is merely sickening.So, it was especially nice to see \"The Orphanage\", a truly creepy, scary ghost story produced by Del Toro and directed by JA Bayona.A brief prologue introduces us to the Orphanage, situated near the ocean. The headmistress takes a phone call and it becomes apparent Laura, who is outside playing with the other five children in the home, will soon be leaving her friends for the comfort of a new family. Many years later, Laura (Belen Rueda), returns to the orphanage with her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their adopted son, Simon (Roger Princep). Laura and her husband have purchased the building and are renovating it to care for five or six children \"with special needs\". As the renovations continue, Simon makes a new invisible friend and begins talking with him. This is really nothing new for Laura and Carlos, Simon has other invisible friends, so they aren't really concerned. But when Laura takes Simon down to the beach, and they explore the caves, Laura begins to suspect something is different. During the party, to celebrate the opening of their house, Laura has a run in with a strange child wearing a scarecrow mask and Simon disappears. Laura and Carlos search desperately for Simon, following every lead and looking everywhere. They meet a man who agrees to help and brings in a medium, Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin, Charlie's daughter). Infrared equipment is set up everywhere and they watch Aurora's every move as she tries to communicate with the spirits, the presence she feels. After a particularly harrowing moment, she comes back to the present and tells them they have many spirits roaming the house. Six to be precise. As Laura becomes more and more determined to find Simon, she also begins to unravel the secrets behind the other visitors in the house.\"The Orphanage\" isn't so much about horror, or shock value, as it is about setting the mood for events that will transpire, creating suspense. From the moment Laura, Carlos and Simon return to the orphanage, to set up their home, we know they have made a bad decision. Why would Laura want to return to the orphanage where she grew up, to set up her new home? This seems strange at first. Was she drawn back to this place? Is there some tie with it, making her return? Then, we learn of Laura and Carlos' plan to reopen the home and care for children with development problems and disabilities. Laura wants to give back some of the help and kindness she received as a child, leading her to take on this huge task.As Laura and Carlos go about setting up this house, they try to provide a normal family life for Simon. But Simon has special needs of his own, and they try to deal with, and address these needs. They try to go about their normal activities, but every time they hear a crash, Laura stops and shudders, not from fright, but because some worker somewhere has probably cost her some more money or delay the project. This is a great way for the filmmakers to divert attention, to give us some false chills, and make the real scares even better.As they get settled in, and begin to explore the grounds. Laura tells Simon about the lighthouse just a bit away, and how she and the other children used to find comfort in it's light. She and Simon spend a lot of time together and begin to explore the grounds. One day, as they enter a cave on the beach, Simon tells his mother of his new friend. Laura has clearly heard of other invisible friends in Simon's life and seems to give it little regard, until he runs off and she sees two sets of footprints.When they are ready to open the house to the other children, they throw a party to welcome everyone. But Simon disappears and Laura has a run-in with a child wearing an old smock, like she wore at the orphanage when she was a child. More bothersome, the child is also wearing a burlap mask with a big smile painted on. Who is this child?When they realize Simon is gone, Laura and Carlos put everything else on hold to search for their son.As all of this is going on, I was amazed at how well Bayona maintains the feel of impending horror. The key to this success lies in how realistic everything appears. Laura's impending dread is almost palpable and Rueda does a great job of making her seem real. As the film progresses, the relationship between Laura and Carlos takes some natural turns and develops in a real way.But everything kicks into high gear when the medium, Aurora, played by Geraldine Chaplin, appears. Carlos is reluctant to go along with this, but because he loves his wife, he follows her lead. And Laura is willing to try anything and everything to find their son. Aurora's associates set-up elaborate recording equipment throughout the house. Then, they put her in the old children's bedroom and watch as she tries to communicate with the spirit or spirits in the house. She almost immediately makes contact and begins to walk through the house, trying to find out more about them, about what they need. As Aurora talks to these spirits, we follow her progress as Laura does, watching everything through monitors, the images captured in grainy green infrared monitors. As we follow her progress, we believe she is actually communicating with these spirits and hope she will be able to make some sort of breakthrough.Chaplin does a great job of making this character believable, scary, yet natural. Aurora believes she can communicate with the dead. Because she believes, there is no reason for her to protest when other people doubt. She knows the truth.More importantly, this sequence is all the more effective because we are watching along with Carlos and Laura, as Aurora progresses through the rooms. We don't see ghosts, or spirits materialize out of thin air, we only hear Aurora trying to communicate with them. We only hear what she says, and it is cryptic at best, but it is very effective at making the scene creepy and spine tingling.Then, Laura continues to search and when the truth is finally revealed, we feel everything she feels.I guess, long story - short (I know, too late), what I am trying to say is Guillermo Del Toro is quietly trying to revive the ghost story, the horror film, and wants us to feel the genuine scares and chills behind the characters and the stories. He is making some scary films, and he is earning our fright with intelligent, well-made efforts that just might prove more influential than the current crop of torture porn.\"The Orphanage\" is very successful at creating a mood of impending horror, terror and dread, using none of the techniques we have become accustomed to in horror films.

This is where she was raised when she was a little girl, and Laura is going to open a new orphanage here for the handicapped children with her husband and adapted son Sim&oacute;n. When everything is going well, however, some strange things start to happen. And finally during the party Sim&oacute;n disappears suddenly, as if spirited away.Some say \"The Orphanage\" is a ghost story, some a supernatural thriller. Whatever the film is, it owes its success to Bel&eacute;n Rueda as Laura. The Spanish star literally becomes the character she plays, a tormented mother whose beloved son is long missing. Her acting is so strong and her character's sadness sometimes so painful to see that \"The Orphanage\" ultimately becomes an intense mother-and-son drama, even though the son is not always there.True, most of the narrative devices in the Spanish film \"The Orphanage\" are not particularly new - a little boy \"speaking\" with his \"imaginary friend\" or the \"secrets\" of an old house have been dealt with so many times before. But there is something very unique about The Orphanage,\" that is, something unnerving that curiously stays in your mind long after watching the film itself. It is hard for me to describe the nature of it. Maybe it is the shocking \"truths\" about the orphanage and the missing case. Or maybe it is some of the film's very spooky scenes or the ending that defies our expectations. All I can say is see for yourself.The film is co-produced by Guillermo del Toro, of \"Pan's Labyrinth.\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Ghost Story and Mother's Love", "unixReviewTime": 1250467200, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2009"},

There's also a woman who had some information and was also a caregiver for a deformed boy; unfortunately, she is accidentally run over before she can tell Laura, the mother, what she needs to know.The boy, Simon, disappears with the ghost kids and his heartbroken parents spend months searching for him.All of this ends with life after death; Laura, Simon and the others die, but they seem to be very much alive, with Laura caring for them in the nursery since they will not grow any older, and Simon is reunited with her as well.There is even a hint at the end that Laura's husband is greeted by her and the boy, though we will never know for sure.It seems to be a common thread in this director's work that the living and the dead, the reality and the fantasy, are very close together and sometimes intermingle with each other.

It is high on atmosphere [the imposing gothic mansion in a remote location, sinister looking people, mysterious noises] and has a riveting plot.The story centers around Laura [Belen Rueda] who has moved into her childhood home, an orphanage, with her husband Carlos [Fernando Cayo] a doctor, and their 7 year old son Simon [Roger Princep] who like most children his age has an overactive imagination and an abundance of imaginary friends.They settle in nicely into the old mansion until one day when they go down to the beach to play - Simon lingers in a cave and when Laura comes to get him, he claims he was talking to a 'friend' and even leaves a trail of seashells so that his friend, Tomas can follow him back to the house. At first Laura dismisses Simon's ramblings as the figment of his imagination but soon comes to fear a more sinister  force at play as a game of  'find the treasure' seems much too elaborate to have been cooked up by Simon, revealing a secret that she wishes to keep from Simon.The story gets truly going when a party to welcome the newcomers [Laura and Carlos had decided to take in about 5-6 children into their home, all with some sort of disability] results in the tragic disappearance of Simon [who had opted to play with his imaginary friend than join in the festivities]. The rest of the story centers around Laura's desperate attempts to find her son, even resorting to hiring psychics [one played by Geraldine Chaplin in a very credibly portrayed role] whilst her husband plays the role of the skpetic, refusing to believe in any supernatural explanation for Simon's disappearance.There are some truly chilling moments in this movie - the sinister child with a sack over its face watching Laura in a darkened hallway, mysterious banging sounds that waken Laura at night,the psychic summoning and the discovery of some of the house's old secrets - all these add to the storyline and keep viewers engaged. Though the acting itself is not extraordinary, except perhaps for Belen Rueda's convincing mother in distress Laura, and Geraldine Chaplin's psychic, this is not an issue for the real pull of the movie lies in the subtle unfolding of the plot through a series of 'clues' that lead Laura to what she seeks.A highly recommended ghost story that doesn't rely on any gore, sex or unnecessary special effects, but allows the natural light and atmosphere coupled with some very effective old school effects to tell a classic ghost story.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A classic multi-faceted ghost story", "unixReviewTime": 1208822400, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2008"},

Alternately described as \"brilliant\" and \"complete trash,\" there were very few who straddled the middle on this political zombie satire. Needless to say, this intrigued me to contemplate how Dante would follow up this divisive little tale. Well, for Season Two, Dante clocks in with \"The Screwfly Solution.\" It certainly has a provocative topic, and is the ultimate battle of the sexes--but I suspect that it is a lot less likely to engender the passionate debate of \"Homecoming.\" That is not a criticism, however, as I think this episode stands as one of the more sophisticated entries we've seen so far!Contemplating the end of the world, \"Screwfly\" offers a new take on the apocalypse genre. A virus affecting men is discovered where if the man is to become sexually aroused--his feelings end up turning to a murderous rage. Needless to say, this doesn't bode well for the women of the world--as this rage is directed at them! While this may, on the surface, seem to be a bit (or a lot) misogynistic--the disease is handled well and its repercussions are real, unpleasant and not taken lightly. The principles include Jason Priestly and Elliott Gould as researchers trying to combat the virus, but this just may take the ultimate toll on their families.\"Screwfly\" may not be scary in the traditional sense if you're looking for quick thrills, but the premise is chilling and disturbing and it leads to appropriate gruesomeness. The tale is well acted and sometimes harrowing, with an emotional context I haven't found often in the \"Masters of Horror\" series. In fact, through most of the film, I thought I might be scoring this episode at 5 stars--that's how pleasantly surprised I was by this tale. The end scenes, however, may be a bit prolonged for some viewers. That didn't bother me as it brought the real domestic dilemma of this story to the forefront. But, at the last minute, the film provides us with an unnecessary explanation for the whole catastrophe which was both unnecessary and not worthy of what has preceded it. This terrific tale went wrong in the end, but that doesn't keep it from being one of the best this show had to offer!

I loved the design and I loved the idea thta I could work this into my collection. I had gotten plenty of things that did not fit exactly rigth and, to be honest, I was not worried. I loved the way it looked adn i loved the way it seemd to be a centerpiece. The problem was that it was nothing like what i envisioned.When I got the set, there was an issue of sliding DVDs that really made life a mess. Considering the investment there was not turning back, and that meant that I was stuck with something that didn't work out. I always take my DVDs out of the packaging when they are weirdly designed, too, trying to keep them from harm. Still, this is not one of those things you could do. The packaging already did a number of some of the DVDs and, sadly, I was left picking up the scratches. I'm glad they have new sets to get rid of those but, beyond that, there is the idea of getting what you pay for.

If you want to actually see real chefs check out the cooking channels Iron Chef this show is just about a bunch of wannabes trying to pretend to be good cooks just for their fifteen minutes of fame and a chance for a comfy position,  I mean you can't help but laugh as Ramsays tears into the contestants as they spoil the entrees and dishes in rather spectacular style most of the times and you can't help but laugh as some of the impostor chefs mess up their cooking from mashed potatoes to salads.  At the end it really isn't so much about the contestants but just watching as Ramsays goes about criticizing the ineptitude of these fake chefs,  and while it's enjoyable it also becomes annoying too somewhat as you watch the background backstabbing of these people when they're forced to choose someone for elimination from the show.

Working along side her partner Marshall Mann (Fred Weller), she helps witnesses adjust to their new life in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Since most of these people are criminals who agreed to testify against other criminals, that isn't always easy.  For example, there's the con artist who may or may not have set her sights on a new mark, yet gets her picture in the paper.  There's the man who brings his wife and mistress into the program only to decide it was time to break up with his mistress.  And even when the witnesses are innocent, their lack of desire to leave their old life behind them can lead to problems, too.If all that weren't enough, Mary's personal life is far from calm.  She is supporting her dead beat mother (Lesley Ann Warren) and her sister Brandi (Nichole Hiltz).  Not only has Brandi fallen for Mary's sometimes boyfriend Raphael (Cristian de la Fuente), but she is also hiding methamphetamine until her boyfriend can arrange the sale.  What will happen when that little bombshell comes out?Personally, I'm still not quite sure what to make of this show.  At times, I am quite interested in seeing how things turn out.  Then I get fed up with the soap opera nature of Mary's personal life.  More often then not, Mary comes across as smug and condescending instead of human and funny, which I have a feeling is what they are aiming for.  And the way she lets herself get manipulated by her family drives me crazy.  And yet I keep watching because I need to know what will happen next.  And I will tune in when the second season starts.I certainly can't fault the acting in any of this.  The actors all do an impeccable job of bringing their characters to life, flaws and all.

Before he worked as the \"Clown Prince of Crime,\" he appeared in two episodes of The Flash TV series as Barry Allen's answer to this deadly villain: James Jesse alias The Trickster! During the early stages of this TV series, most of the villains were either generic throwaway thugs or fabricated knock-offs of classic DC characters (notably Nightshade/The Original Sandman), but along with the appearance of Captain Cold(Michael Champion) and Mirror Master(David Cassidy), Hamill's Trickster was part of a long-awaited adaptation of members of The Flash's Classic Rogues Gallery.In this Rematch episode, he's sprung from facing trial by a new partner, Prank. Some would call her Harley Quinn before-the-fact and they wouldn't be too far off.While The Bad Guy's plot regarding how to deal with The Good Guy was an interesting twist, Julie \"Catwoman\" Newmar and Victor \"King Tut\" Buono did the same thing with Adam \"Batman\" West and Burt \"Robin\" Ward a few decades earlier, which made this installment less-than-great but not-that-bad.

I'll state this now, in case I'm mixing up episodes. I have seen this but I'm reviewing after not having seen it in a while. So, don't be to hard.The whole idea of Teyla having an alteration to be a Wraith for the time being is really interesting. Especially how Todd manipulates events to his wants. I do enjoy Teyla's use of her authoritative position at the end where she warns Todd about her coming back in the event that he does something that she would not want him to. She can be very intimidating when she wants to be.I won't say much more, but I'll give good points on the creativity of the episode and the acting. Teyla, the actor playing her more specifically, did an excellent job. I can't imagine dealing with having to put all that make-up on.However, I'm going to stop there, as I'm not really one to delve into the actors themselves, other than to rate them as something along the lines of good or bad.Anyway, the episode was very good. It put Todd in a position of power whilst taking down the Queen. However, even though the Wraith to Human potion, as I'll call it, didn't get to go into place, I think it flows with the episodes. With it, it would cut the series short, and that would put a downer on our want for more.So, the Wraith war continues. Good episode. I hope people continue to enjoy the series.Just to note in ending, I'll apologize now if any of this information is out of place.

While not tying everything in a neat package in the end, this one has loose ends.  Not enough to turn off those who stuck with the program for five seasons.  Rodney McKay, John Shepard and the rest, don't meet a terrible demise.  The show ends on a positive note. The evil Wraith, while not entirely finished, won't be bothering earth for some time.I recommend the program because it follows the tradition of SG-1 with a set of likable characters.

It was good to see Colm Meany and the actor that portrayed the chief engineer on Enterprise in other roles.

If only this studio was in charge of the Star Trek franchise!  They seem to be delivering much more in terms of action and dramatic possibilities.  There was more adventure in five years of Stargate: Atlantis than in seven years of Star Trek: Voyager.  The writers were fans of Star Trek and it shows in the writing.I wonder if they had to get permission from Paramount to use the beam up gimmick Trek utilizes so frequently?

Season Five, however, shifted increasingly back to the episodic format.  There were some longer story arcs, but sadly most of the episodes were standalone.  This isn't to say that there weren't some good individual episodes, but the show lacked the narrative cohesion that drove the previous season and made it so enjoyable.As with Season Four, a significant number of the best episodes involved the wraith Todd, as Dr. Keller created a genetic modification made it possible for wraiths to subsist on regular human food.  There were hints from time to time that this was leading to a dramatic realignment among the wraith, but this was never pushed to its logical conclusion.  This was symptomatic of the entire season, with a lack of story arcs that would bring the series to any kind of overall conclusion.  Given that they knew well before the end of the season that the series was not going to be renewed, one would have hoped for a better send off.In the end, the series was a show with a lot of unrealized potential.  They had a great concept with Atlantis, the Ancients, and the Wraiths, but the show was hurt by a failure to write strong long story arcs and by some weaknesses in the cast.  Joe Flanigan and David Hewlett were marvelous as Col. Sheppherd and Rodney McKay, but too few in the rest of the cast came up to their level, and most of the other characters were either weakly written or never really developed to the degree that one might have wished.  Still, the series as a whole did provide a good viewing experience.  I think five seasons is about the right number for most shows.  Most shows decline somewhat after that many seasons.  While ATLANTIS was not as interesting in Season Five as in earlier seasons, it hadn't gone on so long that it became unlikable.  And at its best, the show was a lot of fun, with some very good viewing moments.

Monk is a former San Francisco police department detective who had to go onto disability from the force because his OCD psychiatric disorder incredibly worsened after his wife was murdered by a fire bomb in her car.  On its face, this sounds like it could be offensive as it satirizes a mental disorder.  However, Monk is so lovable yet so aggravating with his OCD disorder that it works.  Monk now consults with the police department.  The reason he is such a good detective is because of his OCD.  He notices everything.  He is a fountain of information, including esoteric trivia, which he gravitates towards due to his illness.  Put it all together and he can reach amazing deductions although he drives everyone around him completely bats.Some viewers feared the series would suffer when the gal friday was replaced (from Sharona to Natalie) but there were no repercussions.  Monk is so totally the show, which everyone else revolves around, that the change caused barely a ripple.  As the series has gone on, it has evolved into more of a comedy and a character study which is also a mystery.  Monk always solves a murder but that is secondary to everything else going on.  Two characters I would miss are Leland Stotelmeyer, the Captain, and his sidekick Randy.  They have grown very funny in their own right and are the next strongest characters to Monk himself.  A month ago I rewatched every single episode of Monk and found myself every bit as fascinated with the episodes as I'd been the first time through.  If anything, I was even fonder of Monk this second viewing through.  Some excellent guest stars have also been on the series.  Gena Rowlands was on one episode in season 7 and she was magnificent with Monk.  I've read she's up for an Emmy for it.  John Turturro has also guest starred as Monk's brother and he was also wonderful.One loss to the show is that Monk's psychiatrist died (the actor in real life and thus the character on the show too).  This relationship had been building with every season and the two, Monk and shrink, were very good together.  Those pairings had been growing so it was a regular for them to have a session.  There were some great sessions between them with both insightful and comedic moments.  However, that is being soft pedaled now that a new shrink for Monk had to brought in.  This new shrink is ok but it is not the same.Tony Shalhoub plays Monk and he is wonderful.  The one thing the viewers would never accept is a new Monk.

Start mourning now, because it's still one of the best shows on TV.In the meantime, the seventh season of his dramedy/mystery series holds up well and shows little signs of its age. It's got everything you'd expect of \"Monk\" -- new phobias, personal crises (shot in the leg!), lots of hilarious writing, bizarre mysteries, and the celebration of Mr. Monk's one-hundredth case.Monk is having more trouble than ever after Dr. Kroger unexpectedly dies, and the neighbor girl starts playing the piano. So he decides to buy the house of an old man who recently fell down the stairs. Unfortunately, some creepy people want to get their greedy hands on whatever is hidden in that house -- and they'll destroy his dream-house to do it.Unfortunately (for Monk) it's the least weird case he encounters this season. He has to deal with (in no particular order): a murdered homeless man, miraculous fountains, lottery murders, a stolen bike at a biotech lab, submarine \"suicides,\" exploding grills, protecting a boxer, the impossible murder of Monk's annoying neighbor, and a manly-bonding football game with Stottlemeyer.And Monk struggles with his own problems, with the help of his new therapist Dr. Bell (Hector Elizondo) and his assistant Natalie (Traylor Howard: bad hypnosis, a kindly old lady, a crush, a looming physical, and a half-brother escaped from prison. And Monk tries to stop the parking lot where Trudy died from being demolished, only for the council-woman involved to be found murdered in the bay...Most quirky TV series don't survive past the first few episodes, or the first season at most. So while the seventh season of \"Monk\" has a few bumps in the road (such as \"Mr Monk and the Bully,\" where he comes across as rather too vindictive), it still has the right balance of humor, poignancy and brain-twisters.The whole season is pretty much a solid string of enjoyably complex murder mysteries -- baffling crimes, obscure clues, and a few new eccentricities for Monk. Despite all the murder and bittersweet moments, the episodes are peppered with some comedy as well (Randy watching the football game upside-down in the stairwell) and plenty of solid dialogue (\"It's a square tomato. You're doing the Lord's work!\").This season Monk's biggest problem is his biggest phobia of all -- his fear of being left by everyone, whether it's a mother substitute or his beloved shrink. Fortunately Shalhoub has the skill to keep his tragicomic character from seeming cartoonish -- good-hearted, socially clueless (see \"guy banter\") and trapped in the cage of his own fears and sorrow. The only flaw is that for some reason, Monk tends to be a wee bit more mean-spirited here.Traylor Howard does a solid job as Monk's assistant Elizondo is quite good as the replacement for Dr. Kroger, and Jason Gray-Stanford continues to be hilarious as Randy (\"Ergo the killer. Is that Hungarian?\"). Ted Levine gets to show different side to Stottlemeyer, when the longtime cop becomes a monk (yes, the religious kind) and goofs off at tailgate parties.

Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is still obsessive, compulsive, and phobic.  But he is still able to consult for the SFPD and help old friends Randy Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) and Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) solve difficult cases thanks to the help of his assistant Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard).What has changed is his psychiatrist.  After the death of actor Stanley Kamel, Dr. Kroger was also killed off, giving us a great case for the first episode.  Monk is desperate to get away from a song that reminds him of Dr. Kroger, so he buys a house, only to find out about a mysterious death that took place there.  Joining the cast in that episode is Hector Elizondo as Monk's new doctor, Dr. Bell.From there, things settle down to normal.  Or as normal as you can have it for Monk.  Monk and Natalie get trapped on a submarine.  Monk takes on a chess master who might have committed the perfect crime.  Stottlemeyer witnesses a miracle and becomes a religious monk.  Monk makes friends with his neighbor, only to find she's a murder suspect.  In the only development relating to Trudy's murder, Monk attempts to keep the parking garage where she died from being turned into a park.And I have to mention my favorite episode of the season.  The special 100th episode is full of fun.  Yes, Monk solves a new case.  But the episode also features appearances by quite a few people we've met over the course of the show so far.  It was very funny and a very clever way to mark the momentous occasion.Unfortunately, this season is as uneven as the previous season was.  Yes, I still enjoyed it.  But the comedy and tender moments aren't as natural or real as they have been in previous seasons.  Actually, the first half started strong.  It was the second half where things fell into predictable molds once again.  The writers seem to be running out of steam and going for the cheap laugh over the real character moments that make this show for me.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the season.  It just wasn't as strong as it could have been.The show is slipping from its peak, which makes me happy that this was the penultimate season.

I have read some of the negative reviews of this season, and I have to say that the reviewers are missing the main points here, Monk is an evolving character leading up to a conclusive ending in December of 2010. Season 7, shows Monk getting away from the use of the wipes, every time he touches someone or something, this is huge. There are other steps toward interdependency as well. All leading up to the finale episodes when all is resolved for Adrian Monk.  I for one, prefer to see an ending to the TV shows I watch. Monk clearly has issues, that's what makes him so lovable as a character, but to see those issues reach a resolution by the ending of the series is what we as viewers want in a series. Season 7, has set up the parameters for those resolutions.

She is frequently forced to balance her personal issues with smoking, drinking, and sex with difficulties between her family and friends, her high-stress job in law enforcement -- and not to mention her interactions with an angel named \"Earl\" who has been sent by God to convince Grace to turn away from her evil ways to God. Grace may be on the road to hell, but, with Earl's spiritual guidance, she may be able to save herself.Saving Grace: Season 2 follows the continued adventures of Grace as she deals with her turbulent relationship with fellow detective Ham, her friends' Doug and Maggie's impending wedding, the ever-present fear of death for Grace's friend Leon, the day-to-day drama of working with homicides, the constantly lurking memory of the 1993 Oklahoma City bombing and of course, Grace's journey through faith. While just as intense as the first season, Season Two builds on the spiritual questions and character-centric stories that the series is known for.The cast of Saving Grace is phenomenal, led by Holly Hunter's believable, relate-able performance as Grace. Other key performances include Leon Rippy (Earl) and Bokeem Woodbine (Leon), who have amazing intensity and chemistry on screen that make their semi-intellectual conversations about death, life and faith resonate with viewers and force them to reflect on their own lives. Kenny Johnson (\"Ham\") has perfect chemistry with Hunter and delivers a heartfelt performance as a passionate detective who must balance his odd, off-again, on-again physical relationship with Grace while still maintaining a certain level of professionalism.While the plots of Saving Grace seem a little soap opera-like and can occasionally become diluted and slow-paced, each episode is packed with some of the most amazing character development and complex character relationships on television. While the plot can occasionally became inaccessible for me, the characters kept pulling me in and forcing me to keep watching on the edge of my seat just to see what would happen next in the crazy, dramatic world of these characters. The series ends with a bang that will leave viewers moved and emotionally drained.This DVD set includes all 14 episodes from Season 2, in widescreen format. The set also includes two featurettes that document the many successes of Saving Grace -- both on television and in the person lives of the actors -- and a Hollywood-style wrap party where the cast reflects on the series' second season. While these features give an interesting look into the heart behind the drama, it just seems like there could have been more to it -- maybe some episode commentary, more behind-the-scenes footage or even a few deleted or extended scenes that just didn't make the final cut.I also personally enjoyed the fact that this series is set in Oklahoma City rather than in New York, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, or one of the typical locations for cop dramas. Having this unique setting helped to bring something new to a seemingly worn out (and overdone) genre.Saving Grace: Season 2 is a great series for fans of character-driven dramas and cop-associated shows that have a little more depth to them than just figuring out who-dunnit. Each episode delivers a thrilling emotional ride that will stick with viewers long after they turn off the television.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Saving Grace Season 2", "unixReviewTime": 1245196800, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2009"},

While I've never been a big fan of any particular sitcom, this show got me excited about the genre for the first time ever. I was introduced to it by my sister, who brought a borrowed copy of the third season on DVD home with her from college. I ended up watching a few episodes and was very pleasantly surprised by How I Met Your Mother -- it was absolutely hilarious. While I always thought that sitcoms were just full of overly used jokes and cardboard characters, How I Met Your Mother was not only funny and fresh, but felt like it had more depth than the typical sitcom. I was hooked.How I Met Your Mother has a unique storytelling style that continues into season four. The overarching story is being told by an older Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) to his children. The series consists of a series of flashbacks from Ted's 20s and 30s about the lives of himself and his friends living in New York City and, ultimately, how he met his future wife. This frame may seem complex, especially if you haven't tuned in from the beginning, but it's done in a breezy, comfortable manner that feels natural and doesn't confuse viewers. I felt like it was a story that my father could have been telling me because sometimes there are flashbacks within the overarching flashback and scenes and timing are not perfectly linear, which is more like how a person would share memories -- as they are triggered by something else, rather than chronologically.In season four, the gang continues to mature as they enter their 30s. Ted successfully proposes to Stella (Sarah Chalke), but is left at the altar. Ted fights to come to terms with it, and later reenters the dating scene after becoming roommates with ex-girlfriend Robin (Cobie Smulders). Ted is later laid off from his job, and he decides to begin his own architecture firm. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) struggles with growing feelings for Robin. While Barney continues his usual womanizing ways, tension grows between him and Robin as Barney's feelings start to come out. Meanwhile, Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan) move into their new apartment and struggle with whether or not they're ready to have children. Each character's world changes throughout the series, building up for more antics in season five.The cast of How I Met Your Mother does a perfect job of playing off one another, making the jokes and punch lines feel snappy and well-utilized. While many comedies run the risk of overdoing jokes, How I Met Your Mother does a fantastic job of balancing the joke surrounding an episode with all of the characters. By far, the best (and most hilarious) character in this show is the awe-(wait for it...)-some Barney Stinson with his unnamed corporate job, endless supply of suits, and constant bedding of various women. Barney is always up to something off-the-wall and funny, no matter what's happening in the lives of the other characters.The season four DVD set includes all 24 episode on three discs in widescreen format with English 5.1 Dolby Surround sound plus English, French, and Spanish subtitles -- not to mention a great selection of bonus features. These features include a recap of season three, episode commentaries, a gag reel, \"A Night with Your Mother\" special featuring an Academy of Television Arts & Sciences panel discussion, a hilarious gag video about how awesome Barney is, and an extended scene from \"The Fight.\"Season four is another great chapter in the How I Met Your Mother saga. The series is just as humorous as when it first began, and the characters continue to be interesting and funny. The amazing thing for me about this series is how it can cover such a range of emotions in just one episode. I don't usually respond to TV or movies emotionally, but How I Met Your Mother can make me roll around laughing and takes me to the brink of tears in the same episode. I can't wait for the new season to start.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Suit Up!", "unixReviewTime": 1253491200, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2009"},

Ted has a problem when Stella wants him to move to New Jersey and the gang tries to talk him out of moving. As the wedding draws near Ted tells Stella that he invited Robin and Stella gets mad because she does not want a significant ex to be at the wedding so Ted invites Tony, Stella's ex. This turns out to be not a good idea as it turns out that Stella gets back with Tony.Barney deals with his feelings for Robin in Season 4. He is jealous at Ted because after coming back from Japan Robin lives with Ted for a while. While living with him they become friends wit benefits so that their bad habits wont get on each others nerves.Barney helps Robin though by making her a great audition tape that gets her a job as an anchor for a 4 am show. He also helps Marshall get a job as in house council at GNC (the bank he works for.)Marshall and Lilly are debating on wither or not they should have a baby.Near the end of the season Ted runs into Stella and Tony who help him find a job. During this time Tony breaks up with Stella, but eventually work things out. Tony and Stella and move to California where a few years after Tony writes a screen play about the triangle that gets made into a popular movie.

We all know she isn't the mother because the show is already in its sixth season by now without her! Just like with Robin before her, the audience is playing the waiting game for it to end. Ted faces a difficult year between problems with Stella, unemployment, Marshall and Lily moving into their own place, and as always confusing signals between himself and Robin.Marshall played by Jason Segel and Lily played by Alyson Hannigan begin to move on and become full adults and have issues with their new apartment and contemplate parenthood for the first time. Robin played by Cobie Smulders has difficulties with losing her job, almost getting deported, and exploring a friends with benefits relationship. Barney played by Neil Patrick Harris continues to be AWESOME but after realizing the extent of his feelings for Robin at the end of Season 3, he spends this entire season pining away for her and manipulate her relationships while staying quiet about his intentions. While it is fun to see Barney reveal a soft spot, the audience doesn't enjoy seeing him so vulnerable that it effects his game with the other ladies.Bonus Features:The most disappointing part of the bonus features on this one is that this season has the least amount of episodes with commentary (four) and three of them are with show creators and/or writers and only one episode, \"The Naked Man\" has actor commentary...and it is with Josh Radnor who you all know by now plays my least favorite character. However, it did confirm that Alyson Hannigan and Cobie Smulders were pregnant during the season which I totally suspected since they kept wearing REALLY loose clothing and holding things like popcorn buckets in front of their stomachs.Other features include the \"Barney Stinson: That Guy's Awesome\" music video with all the power words falling from the sky and exploding, but does not include Barney interviewing himself with a British accent. There is also a Season 3 recap, another gag reel of silly moments, and lastly, there is an Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Panel discussion called \"A Night With Your Mother\" featuring the show creators and main cast members that is less than 20 minutes. They discuss how Barney and Robin's relationship came about as an emergency tactic after the writer's strike. There is also a hilarious highlight where Neil Patrick Harris leaves to go to the bathroom with is microphone still on and everyone is laughing to the point of tears.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "How I met YOUR mother!!", "unixReviewTime": 1296345600, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2011"},

Each season shows Ted and his friends experiencing all of the moments and antics that will eventually/hopefully lead to Ted meeting and falling in love with his future wife. In general, it's probably necessary to have watched the previous seasons before jumping in at Season 4, since there are references to the past and previous character development plays a role. This is a well-written and family appropriate show that keeps fans begging for more.Season 4 kicked off in the fall of 2008 with main characters:  Josh Radnor as Ted Mosby, Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson, Cobie Smulders as Robin Scherbatsky, Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin, and Jason Segel as Marshall Eriksen.  As the series progresses it is also picking up more and more celebrity cameos [ehem, did you know that the voice of \"future Ted\" in the precaps is actually Bob Saget?]; season 4 features:  Sarah Chalke as Stella Zinman, Regis Philbin as himself, Erin Cahill as Heather Mosby, Bill Fagerbakke as Marvin Eriksen, Alex Trebek as himself, and Jason Jones (from The Daily Show) as Tony Grafanello.I generally prefer the DVD versions to Blu-Ray because it can be a pain to wait on a slow Blu-Ray Player.  That being said, the picture and sound qualities are fantastic in this format.SEASON 4:  Following three seasons of Ted and his single friends'(pardoning Marshall and Lily) shenanigans, Season Four gives us a look into the deep desire of each member of the gang to be happily settled--but don't worry, nothing is set in stone just yet.  This season seems to mark some changes in the group, revealing some character \"flaws\" that ultimately bring viewers closer to the emotional needs of the main cast and elicits reinvestment in their futures--namely Ted's and his hunt for the woman he calls his kids' mother.Episode 1:  \"Do I Know You?\"--Stella and Ted are getting married as feelings develop between Barney and Robin.Episode 2:  \"The Best Burger In New York\"--The gang (and Regis Philbin) seek out the diner that served Marshall's first burger in New York.Episode 3:  \"I Heart NJ\"--The gang ventures to New Jersey to see Stella's home, and the home Stella hopes Ted will call his own.Episode 4:  \"Intervention\"--Ted calls a re-intervention over his engagement.Episode 5:  \"Shelter Island\"--Ted and Stella rush to the altar, but feelings get altered by old flames.Episode 6:  \"Happily Ever After\"--The gang reminisces about old enemies.Episode 7:  \"Not a Father's Day\"--Lily and Marshall have baby talk, but seek advice in Robin and Ted.  Barney celebrates NOT being a father... or a husband... or a boyfriend, for that matter.Episode 8:  \"Woooo!\"--Ted offers his design plans for the company's new building; Robin has a little crisis and seeks affirmation from a group of \"Woooo! Girls.\"Episode 9:  \"The Naked Man\"--After getting an eyeful of Robin's boyfriend, Ted finds a way to revitalize the gang's love lives.Episode 10:  \"The Fight\"--Ted, feeling a little emasculated from the Stella debacle, lets the rage fly as he and Barney compete for Robin's attention.Episode 11:  \"Little Minnesota\"--While Ted's sister visits, Marshall and Robin do some bonding at a bar featuring their favorite pastime, hockey.Episode 12:  \"Benefits\"--A frustrated Robin and Ted decide to alleviate some stress, but not if Barney can help it.Episode 13:  \"Three Days of Snow\"--Carl (foolishly) gives command of the bar to Barney and Ted as Marshall and Lily try to reunite despite a blizzard.Episode 14:  \"The Possimpible\"--Facing deportation, Robin resorts to the help of Barney in order to find a job.Episode 15:  \"The Stinsons\"--The gang uncovers Barney's secret wife and son.Episode 16:  \"Sorry, Bro\"--For fear that Ted may try to rekindle an old flame with a girlfriend they hated, Lily and Marshall devise a plan to keep Ted from ex-girlfriend Karen.Episode 17:  \"The Front Porch\"--Battles emerge between Lily and Ted when Ted discovers she has been sabotaging his relationships.Episode 18:  \"Old King Clancy\"--Marshall and Barney cook up a cover story to protect Ted from learning a devastating truth about his job.Episode 19:  \"Murtaugh\"--Barney discovers Ted's \"Impossible Bucket List\" and takes it as a challenge.Episode 20:  \"Mosbius Designs\"--Marshall looks a little foolish trying to impress people at work; Ted forms his own architectural company and hires an interim intern.Episode 21:  \"The Three Days Rule\"--Barney and Marshall punish Ted for a dating-rule taboo.Episode 22:  \"Right Place, Right Time\"--Barney hits a ladies-milestone as Ted appreciates all the variables that put him in the right place at the right time.Episode 23:  \"As Fast as She Can\"--Barney makes his own challenge for dodging a traffic ticket; a guilty Tony tries to atone by helping Ted find a job.Episode 24:  \"The Leap\"--Ted feels the weight of his business while Marshall tries to bring him up to a party.

Prison Break is one of the best shows FOX has aired in a long time, and it was sad to see it go.The season opens with Michael (Wentworth Miller) tracking down Mahone (William Fichtner), Whistler (Chris Vance), and Gretchen (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) to avenge the death of his beloved Sara (Sarah Wayne Callies). However, once he finds Gretchen, the truth isn't what it originally seemed. Partial secrets are revealed, and a mysterious new player appears.Soon after, Michael and Lincoln (Dominic Purcell) are pursued by a Homeland Security agent, who wants to blackmail them into doing his dirty work for him. Michael and Lincoln agree to the agent's demands. The majority of the season then tells about the intricate operation they work on for the agent, and Michael and Lincoln's attempt to avoid being returned to prison.The show slowly grows to a thrilling climax, where many familiar Prison Break faces return. However, Michael's story doesn't end as perfectly as many fans would have liked.Every performance this season is amazing, as it is in the previous seasons. The characters leap off the screen with their lush, realistic feel. Every actor in this show completely embodies their character.  Miller is a hard-edged, driven actor who draws you into the character's world. His chemistry with Purcell is amazing. The two characters show strong bonds of brotherhood and help get another through the crazy happenings in their lives.This DVD set includes a decent collection of extras, such as two featurettes on the series and its ending and commentary soundtracks for some of the episodes. While I really enjoyed the commentary tracks that exist, it would be far better to have them on all the episodes. I know that there are 22 episodes here, but surely there could be more commentary for the final season? It is also a little surprising that there aren't any deleted or extended scenes from the season. Really, that's part of the reason for getting your favorite TV shows on DVD -- to see more of what was originally filmed for each episode.The biggest issues I have with this release is actually the packaging. I know that sounds a little picky, but the transparent, thin plastic seems cheap and tacky to me -- not to mention it doesn't seem like it will protect the discs very well in the long term. Of course, this new packaging does make the set considerably thinner and lighter, but I somewhat miss the look and feel of the older packaging styles (call me old-fashioned).Season four of Prison Break didn't make every fan happy -- in fact, some fans thought that the series should have ended after the third season.

{"reviewerID": "A34D06JL7LC6MU", "asin": "B001ENOB8Y", "reviewerName": "Joshua Miller \"Josh\"", "helpful": [4, 5], "reviewText": "The Fox series Prison Break debuted in 2005 and had a first season that was intelligently written, intelligently executed, and endlessly exciting. The series miraculously had two more seasons (with season three being cut short due to the writer's strike) and Fox announced the fourth season would be the final season. I absolutely love this show, but the idea to end it was a good one. Prison Break was a one-season concept that made two seasons work but just got more and more ludicrous as it went on, while never failing to be entertaining. With that said, the fourth season is very entertaining. It's this season that the writer's throw all logic out the window. Character's who were dead return, character's who were forgotten come out of nowhere; the writer's of this season seem to have had one rule for writing; if it can go wrong (no matter how implausible), make sure it does.We've followed these character's as they escaped from prison (season one), ran from the law (season 2), and had to escape from another prison (season 3). In season 4, they have to break in to a building. Sounds interesting, right?Everyone has escaped from Sona, the prison in Panama that housed the characters for the third season. Now in Los Angeles, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), his brother Lincoln Burroughs (Dominic Purcell), girlfriend Sarah Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), Brad Bellick (Wade Williams), and former FBI-agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) are recruited by Homeland Security agent Don Self (Michael Rappaport) for a top-secret operation to help take down The Company for good. With an offer of immunity for everyone on the table, the group agrees to help Self retrieve Scylla, the Company's little black book.All of the characters are back, including everybody's favorite villain T-Bag (Robert Knepper), who (as usual) has a different agenda than the rest of the group. Also, in a much larger role, is Leon Russom as General Jonathan Krantz, but more on that in a moment.Season four will have you shaking your head several times throughout simply because of how completely ridiculous many of the plot twists are, but it ranks high on the excitement scale. As for how it ends...Well, those who have followed this show and these characters for years will be divided, but how else could they have ended it? The ending works, but could have been executed a little better.Now, on another note...I'm not the first person to complain about the weak, anything goes-style of writing on Prison Break, but I wish to mention that the writer's never failed to write strong main characters. It's hard to deny this is a show with strong characterization that has a knack for establishing characters for us to care about and establishing characters for us to hate only to trick us into liking them later. But, I will not let the actors escape without credit.Prison Break, during its run, was never honored for the actor's it had on its show. One doesn't have to even watch this show very long to see that this was a shame. Wentworth Miller, for example, is the only person I can see as Scofield. He's quietly menacing, committed, and charismatic...Not to say he doesn't overdo it sometimes, but he balances the tough and emotional in a way most actors would not. If one denies the range of Wade Williams as Bellick, watch all four seasons of this show and tell me how Bellick goes from one of the most unlikeable characters on the show to a very sympathetic one in such a short span of time. Even Purcell, who never had to do much in the series besides look tough and be intimidating when needed, embodies Burroughs. That description of his acting is pretty much all the character needs to do, so it all fits. Finally, we have Robert Knepper whose performance as T-Bag only got better with each season. If this had been a theatrical film as opposed to a TV series, Knepper would have received an Oscar nomination. If not for fan-reaction to Knepper's portrayal of the devious, depraved T-Bag he likely would've been killed off at the end of season one. Knepper takes a relatively simple character and just molds him into one of the most memorable characters I've ever seen on a television series. It's no easy task to take a character that frequently betrays and hurts the character's you care about and make him likeable and every moment Knepper is onscreen, he'll keep your attention focused there. Finally, Russom as the General has a very menacing look coupled with a deep, foreboding voice...He makes a great antagonist for Scofield's gang. All of the other actor's are great too, but this has already taken up a large majority of my review.There's not much to write about the fourth season of a television show. If you're reading this, you've likely seen the previous three seasons or you've already seen all four. If you're a fan, this season is definitely worth checking out if only to see the last hurrah of these character's you've watched for so long. While Prison Break lost some IQ points along the way, it never lost its ability to keep your heart racing and keep your affection for its main set of characters. With that said, if you're a fan of the series...This is essential.GRADE: B", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An Exciting, Anything-Goes Final Season", "unixReviewTime": 1257724800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2009"},

I could easily write a 10 page review detailing the various issues I took exception with, but I will suffice with a complaint list.1. The plethora of plot twists.  Even M. Night Shayamalan would've said enough's enough.2. Bringing people back to life.  I know that they were never confirmed dead, but they were dead enough.  I thought Prison Break was making a bid to be a soap opera.3. The various coalitions.  How many bad guys can you work with just because \"you need them.\"4. The sloppiness of The Company.  Whereas the General wouldn't even say a word in season 2, by season 4 he was a chatty kathy.  He was equally careless with who he killed and how.5. The slipperiness of T-Bag.  T-Bag left almost as many dead bodies in his wake as did The Company but by the end of the show I knew one thing: if a nuclear bomb went off the only survivors would be cockroaches and T-Bag.  He had more lives than a cat and the uncanny ability of always having just enough information to keep himself alive.6. The Scofield boyscout act.  In season 1 and 2 Scofield's reluctance to kill was an endearing quality.  It made you realize that he was no real criminal, he was only in his position due to trying to help his brother.  By season 4 I was sick of the \"I won't kill\" act although he repeatedly faced immenent danger.  Ultimately, that left others to do the killing for him or him accidentally killing people (i.e. the man he hit with a piece of wood then fell and cracked his skull).  The only time Scofield actually pulled a trigger... surprise the gun wasn't loaded.  Heck, Sarah killed more people than Scofield did.7. The resilient bodies.  I finally began to tire of the amazing faces and bodies of the cast.  I don't mean amazing as in stunningly good looking, but as in their abilities to heal so quickly.  Normally I afford a show a lot of leeway when it comes to suspended belief: manhole covers that weigh five pounds, concrete that easily crumbles, abilities to run long distances at top speed, etc.  But, I guess once a show starts to go south every annoyance is amplified.  From the beatings, stabbings, shootings and other abuse Scofield, Burrows, T-Bag, Bellick and Sucre took, they should still be hospitalized.  Scofield didn't even have a visible scar from getting his brain tumor removed.  Their abilities to take beatings and survive and make a full recovery free of any scars or lasting disabilities became unbearable.8. My indifference.  In season 1 I was at the edge of my seat.  I was holding my breath with every close call.  I was exhaling with every escape.  I was enthralled by Scofield's detailed planning.  I was even quite torn up when Lincoln was taken to the electric chair.  All of those emotions and feelings were dulled by season 4.  I was no longer at the edge of my seat, I was no longer exasperated by their capture or thrilled with each triumph.  And that was the single greatest disappointment of season 4.  Each scenario was one that had been played many times before in a different format yet the outcome was always the same.The show lost its umph and lost its luster.  There was a severe lack of imagination and hence a sharp drop in quality.  It seemed like actions of Scofield and The Company were directly proportional to the writing.  As the writing got sloppier, so did Scofield and The Company.  It just sucked to see the show flame out the way it did.  Even the ending was anti-climactic.  The show would have been better off ending at episode 12.

In fact, in seasons 3 and 4, Sweets is a more serious character than he becomes in later seasons with his entanglement with one of Brennan's assistants, Daisy.The season also ends with a bang, with an episode based entirely on a dream, in which all the actors, including returning Eric Millegan, and all other regular and recurring characters appear as characters not their own, and Brennan and Booth are married.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good recovery from season 3", "unixReviewTime": 1379721600, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2013"},

Bala \"Me Too Can Read\"", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewText": "It's that vaunted chemistry and the rich emotional content, and it's those terrific touches of humor. In \"The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond\" there's a great throwaway moment brought about by a publisher's crediting part of Temperance Brennan's success as a mystery author to her looks. Brennan decides to quit writing, and here's Booth talking fast to change her mind:- Brennan: \"I don't want to be a sexy scientist!\"- Booth: \"Well, that's like me saying I don't want to be a sexy FBI Agent. We can't change who we are!\" And then Booth starts quoting a published review of one of her mysteries. One of those perfect throwaway moments.World-renowned forensic anthropologist Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan is as brusque and tactless as ever, as confounded by the subtleties of social decorum as ever (or as Sweets exclaims: \"She is wicked literal!\"). Bones is still very much that intimidating icy intellect, still a wounded soul, and still solving murders. FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth is still the one with the people skills and that well-developed bump of intuition. More onions are peeled in this season as we learn even more about the underpinnings of our core characters. The absolute big draw of this show is that sizzle between David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel, their fabulous interplay tantalizing and frustrating the viewers. Could this be the season that they get together? Well, kind of, sort of. Taking what the show is giving, I wallow in their ever evolving relationship.Staying on the personal, Hodgins and Angela are trying to move past their break-up. \"The Skull in the Sculpture\" demonstrates that Angela is more ready to move on than Hodgins, and if you thought Angela was a free spirit before, well, now...  This episode also has Sweets demonstrating the best way ever to fire someone. Young FBI psychologist Lance Sweets, by the way, becomes a regular cast member in this season, and I like him more and more as each episode progresses, even if Booth and Bones continually treat him like a pesky little brother. Even Dr. Saroyan's past is delved into.Zack Addy, apprentice to the Gormagon Killer, has been institutionalized, which doesn't keep him from strolling out to help the squints on a baffling case. Still, this gives rise to a running theme, that of the rotating roster of interns as Saroyan and Bones attempt to fill Zack's spot, and the fun thing is that each of these interns comes with baggage. There's the morbid one, the excessively chirpy one, the one constantly dispensing trivia, etc. The most martyred one may well be that repressed intern who insists on keeping things professional at all times - except that, the squints being a tight bunch, he keeps getting exposed to a deluge of innuendo and gossip in the workplace.***Possible plot SPOILERS begin***There isn't really a running mystery arc to tie these episodes together - no one like the Gormagon Killer running around, for example. But that doesn't mean that the cases aren't gripping; some of them are really interesting. The season opens with \"Yanks in the U.K.\" (or, as I like to call it, \"Booth Vs. England\"), which plants Brennan and Booth in jolly old England, investigating a murder and running into a British version of themselves. In \"The Passenger in the Oven\" Bones and Booth are on a flight bound to China and have only four hours to solve a murder before the plane lands and Booth loses jurisdiction. \"Double Trouble in the Panhandle\" has Booth and Bones infiltrating the Big Top as \"Buck & Wanda and their Knives of Death,\" and their circus act is actually fraught with more suspense than in just about any other scene in this season.Some other favorites? In \"The Double Death of the Dearly Departed,\" Bones and Booth steal a corpse due for cremation from a funeral home, Bones believing that the body had been \"translated,\" which is Booth's made-up code for murder. \"Mayhem on a Cross\" unveils some dark stuff about Sweets' past, this episode also featuring the return of the awesome Stephen Fry as FBI shrink Gordon Gordon Wyatt. It also had me cracking up whenever Bones insisted on correctly pronouncing \"skalle\" (the Norwegian word for \"skull\"). \"The Hero in the Hold\" features the return of the Grave Digger serial killer. \"The Princess and the Pear\" plonks Bones and Booth's temp replacement in the world of comic book conventions, and Bones finally gets another chance to flash her martial arts mojo.In \"The Critic in the Cabernet\" Bones drops a bomb on Booth and Booth gets advice from a cartoon character, a frivolous conceit which goes on to have a terrifying payoff. Finally Season 4 closes with a quirky fantasy episode featuring a re-shuffling of roles. In this reality, Dr. Saroyan and Booth's brother are homicide detectives and Booth and Bones are a married couple who run a nightclub and who end up as suspects in a murder case. It's neat that just about everyone is in this one.***Possible plot SPOILERS end now***BONES - SEASON FOUR comes in six discs and includes 22 of the 26 episodes. The bonus features are: extended scenes for three episodes: \"The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond,\" \"The Doctor in the Den,\" & \"The Girl in the Mask\"; 2 deleted scenes (one in \"The Skull in the Sculpture,\" the other in \"The Passenger in the Oven,\" both featuring Angela and Hodgins having a conversation about Roxie); 5 and a half minutes of bloopers (\"Skalle!\"); \"Androgeny: Playing Haru Tanaka\" - guest actress Ally Maki delves into her dubiously gendered character (\"Dr. Haru Tanaka\") in \"The Girl in the Mask\"; and \"Squints in Training\" - this segment, which includes cast interviews, goes into this season's cast of recurring lab interns. Again no episode commentaries or cast interviews. Also, note that Season Four's first four episodes (\"The Yanks in the UK, Parts 1 & 2,\" \"The Man in the Outhouse,\" & \"The Finger in the Nest\") are absent here, having instead been inserted inBones: The Complete Third Seasonas that set's featured bonus features.By the way, in the Grossest Corpse of the Season department, it's a tie between \"The Cinderella in the Cardboard\" and \"The Science in the Physicist.\" Icky!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "always digging BONES...", "unixReviewTime": 1255824000, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2009"},

The attempt to bring Zack back, but that is too artificial in a way, does not work beyond one single episode. Of course he is particularly brilliant but with this brilliancy that is so bright it dazzles us. We need someone more evanescent in this laboratory, someone who is never the same and always a come-back again on some rotating basis. So the extra lab-worker is the ever going project to bring back someone that cannot be brought back, hence the character that can experiment all kinds of profiles: English, Japanese, simple intern or certified doctor of something, Moslem or happily paired with a woman and not interested in the constant sexual innuendo in this lab, etc.The second come-back is that of Temperance's father as some kind of museum science guide for visiting children. That one is hard on Temperance who considers her father as a criminal and has not yet forgiven him for abandoning her when a teenager in the custody of her unworthy brother who left and sent her to a foster home in a way. But that ex-science teacher has the knack it takes to have contact with young teenagers and make them like what is in many ways forbidding and austere, or at least can be if you do not know how to make it an adventure. He is a genial awakener for Agent Booth's son Parker and Temperance has to yield to that demand.The third come-back is the British psychologist but in a less flashy role now his barbecue is built. His main role is to set Dr Sweets, the FBI profiler, in perspective, a Dr Sweets who is so shy and so flippantly uncatchable. But he is so efficient and efficacious with the criminals who have to be discovered and caught.The next come-back is that of the Gravedigger, and this time for the finish of that case. The grave-digger manages to kidnap Agent Booth himself and to bury him in a navy ship just before it is blown down into the sea by the navy itself. The point that appears little by little is that the gravedigger has inside information and must be from inside the justice department or the FBI or some other Home Security agency. And that's how they find out that serial killer. At the other end Agent Booth experiences a comeback of a completely different nature. On the ship, while he is trying to escape he is helped by some ghost from deep in his mind, the corporal who was killed practically in his own arms and who he took back to base. Strange come-back but quite natural for all of us: we find help in someone in our minds who makes us keep our cool and find the way out.Then we move to the come-back of Agent Booth's younger brother who is a pain in the back because he is not able to do anything right without the help of his brother and he fails in some situations systematically just to get that help. A come-back and a good-bye too since he goes to India for a motorbike tour, but alone without his big brother. Good riddance in a way and good morning Vietnam in another. But the little boy has to grow one day.The best of this series remains the vast array of cases that bring up a vast selection of social and cultural situations that are all explored in some fine details revealing the horror of this society of ours. Of course there are a lot of winks to other series in the genre. The main wink is to Stephen King who once wrote: \"If you can't terrify your audience, then horrify them. And if you can't horrify them, then gross them out.\" And you can be sure the cadavers, corpses, bodies, bones and other dead remnants of human beings are gross to the utmost. We can of course see here and there an allusion to Dexter, or another one to Crime Scene Investigation. But the style is original and personal.This season finally is very rich to reveal the deeper selves of the characters, with some strange a priori idea that Dr Temperance Brennan, Dr Lance Sweets or Agent Seeley Booth, just like Dr Zack Addy have had a youth of suffering and want on the loving side of life. And that would be why they are great in their present positions. That's too easy. And the characters that are kept in second position like Dr Camille Saroyan, Dr Jack Hodgins or Angela Montenegro cannot qualify at that level.  In other words it is a clich&eacute; that one can only be great if they have suffered in their infancy and youth. But it definitely gives the characters some density on the screen.The last episode is a complete reversal due to some brain tumor and I must say Temperance as the manageress of a club that has more to do with a brothel and an opium den than with a caf&eacute; is quite a change of perspective.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Why do they have only five stars?", "unixReviewTime": 1296172800, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2011"},

This is inetersting but tends to slightly destablise the series since some are good and some are bad.Overall the series remains very good, the production values have been strengthened and Booth and Bones remain extremely enjoyable characters with a lot of funny interaction and tension between them.Maybe overall the stories themselves should improive somewhat because they tend to be repetitive investigations with simply an added gore element to freak us out.

But I fully recognize that it has some of the worst season finales of any show out there.  Thankfully, I still enjoy it and look forward to every season.Bones is a forensic anthropologist.  Well her name isn't really Bones, it is Temperance Brennan, and she works for the Jeffersonian in their lab.  But she contracts out to the FBI and works with her partner Seeley Booth.  Together they solve crime that only leaves behind skeletal remains as clues.  And the rest of the people in the lab are there to back them up. This particular season has them reeling from losing Zack and a flurry of interns have been rushed into the Jeffersonian to take his place.  But they all have their own little quirks.Characters:Emily Deschanel: Temperance BrennanDavid Boreanaz: Seeley BoothMichaela Conlin: Angela MontenegroT.J. Thyne: Jack HodginsTamara Taylor: Camille SaroyanJohn Francis Daley: Lance SweetsBooth and Brennan have great chemistry.  They're why the show works so well.  The tension and emotions there are what keep people coming back for more, even if the storylines aren't always up to par.  Angela and Hodgins kind of took a backseat this time though, and since I really like their parts, that was kind of disappointing.  Sweets is a little better, although he still seems a bit unneeded at times.  And Camille, she never seems to quite fit in to me.  But as a whole they work together well.  And the new revolving cast interns is amusing.Aside from the string of interns, most of these episodes could be considered one-offs.  Well, except maybe the last two and a plot line involving Booth, but that is part of the icky finales I mentioned earlier.  It's like they try to go bigger and more shocking each season, and it just doesn't work.  Maybe they'll finally get into practice with it, but the last two seasons seem to have some issues in that regard.  I do always enjoy the crime solving in this show though.  It's very gritty and realistic (well, as far as I know).And because it's that realistic it can be quite gruesome at times.  Blood, guts, bodies, etc.  And some violence.  It can be a little rough although they don't overly display it.  More of the time is spent on investigation, rather than the gore.  But, some viewer discretion is advised.I love Bones, despite its flaws.  This season is probably about 3.5 stars but the series overall is a good one.

This sort of thing never happens with other shows, but after nine or twelve months between season viewings of \"Heroes,\" I've got to go back for a refresher.

And there was little hope that it was going to get better. But then it did. Much of the improvement might have been the result of one of the greatest tragedies of the 2008-2009 season, ABC's cancellation of one of the best shows in the history of television, PUSHING DAISIES. But one show's tragedy is another's great fortune. Bryan Fuller, who had been a consulting producer for HEROES in its first and promising season (he was given writing credits on what is to this day by far the greatest HEROES episode ever, the brilliant Season One episode \"Company Man,\" was suddenly freed from PUSHING DAISIES, and was made the new show runner for HEROES after several producers and writers were released from the show. The improvement in the show was not instantaneous, but it was close. By the end of the season the show was as interesting as it had been in flashes in Season One.Whether it was Fuller or not, the show had by the end of Season Three begun to have a direction once again. Both Season Two and the first half of Three had seen the show go down a series of confusing and generally unpleasant directions. One story arc had minimal connection with what had gone before and all indications were that they were just making things up as they went along. And what they were making up simply wasn't very good. Has the show finally turned around? If the difference has indeed been Bryan Fuller's involvement, it is entirely possible. I just know that by the end of Season Three I was actually looking forward to each episode again. For ages it was simply something I watched because I had been watching CHUCK.There has been a lot of debate about what went wrong with HEROES, about why it failed to fulfill the potential it displayed in its first season. My own opinion is that the show never took its own name seriously. The truth is that despite its title there were very, very few heroic characters. Having superpowers does not make someone a hero. Being heroic does. But most of the characters were not heroic and most of them struggled more with their own pettiness. And the writers kept taking characters down the most outrageous paths. Like the nerfing of Peter Petrelli, leaving him a defanged puppy. Or making a mess of every character that Ali Larter has played.I don't know what to anticipate for Season Four.  While Season Three may have had much to do with Bryan Fuller returning, he unfortunately has left HEROES once again to develop a new, as yet unannounced, series.  My lone reason for hope is the widespread belief that this once promising show has failed to meet its initial expectations.  Some talented people remain attached to the project.  Hopefully they will pool their resources and produce something worth our time and effort.Last comment:  the retail price for the Blu-ray is absurd.  I buy most of my shows on Blu-ray these days.  I'm struggling internally as to whether to buy HEROES in DVD or Blu-ray.  I don't think any series can justify asking us to spend over $45 for Blu-ray.  I'll make my decision just before it comes out.  If the price drops to around $45 I'll get it on Blu-ray.

Particularly frustrating was their stubborn insistence on focusing on Sylar as the main villian; I enjoyed Sylar during the first two seasons but having a nearly unbeatable foe makes the rest of the cast look weak.  Instead of introducing new heroes, each week brought new alliances between the heroes that quickly dissolved before they really could be explored.  One week Noah and Sylar are working together, then they're enemies; the next week Nathan and Peter have reunited, then they're enemies; shampoo, rinse, and repeat.  Keeping up with these shifting alliances was dizzying and tiresome.  Likewise, all pretences of continuity have been abandoned in favor of ending each episode with a \"shocking\" conclusion.I'll watch at least the first few episodes of Season 4 of \"Heroes,\" as I feel a certain obligation given the time I've already invested in the series.  Also, I do still care a bit about a few of the characters, despite being jerked around by the inconsistent writing of the series.  However, I find that I can no longer recommend the series as a whole to new watchers, which is something I did prior to this season.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Sylar, Sylar, Sylar!", "unixReviewTime": 1249603200, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2009"},

There were times when it managed some of the brilliance it flashed so often in Seasons Two and Three, but a number of the episodes were either just ill-conceived or out and out unpleasant.  The episode where Michael falls apart during a presentation that Holly's new boyfriend attends (and in which Pam takes over) was one of the most painful half hours I've ever experienced while watching TV.  Overall the season just lacked the kind of magic that we saw in previous seasons.  There were no episodes as memorable as \"Business School\" (the episode where Michael lectures in Ryan's business school class, Jim makes Dwight believe that he might have become a vampire, and no one except Michael comes to Pam's art class presentation) or \"Beach Games\" or \"Casino Night.\"  In fact, if I had to list my ten favorite OFFICE episodes, I'm pretty confident that none from Season Five would be on the list.Not that there weren't some great moments.  Absolutely any scene featuring Steve Carrell and Amy Ryan was extraordinary.  Had she been a fulltime character on the show the fortunes of the whole season might have turned out differently.  They complemented someone so perfectly it was surreal.  Their early season rap was one of the best things in the season.  Another highlight was Andy and Angela's engagement and the way in which if fell apart, all while she was continuing her sexual relationship with Dwight.

Can it rebound?  I certainly hope so.  I still love all the characters.  I love that they didn't break up Pam and Jim (and it looks like there is going to be a huge change coming for them in Season Six, if the news that they seemed to have received in the season finale turns out to be true).

When the show finally gets back to its original pattern/format, it feels like slipping into that old familiar spot on the couch again...you might take it for granted while you have it, but removing it from your life will just want it back that much more!Thus, I once again give this season of \"The Office\" my highest approval for its ability to be incredibly funny and still develop characters in a meaningful way.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Keeps Pushing The Envelope By Taking Creative Risks", "unixReviewTime": 1263340800, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2010"},

The other three supporting characters are Tracy and Jenna as competing comedic costars on Lemon's show and Kenneth, a page at NBC, who as a hick from the sticks is a foil for everyone else's urbanity.

The third season showed no signs of slowdown and every episode, you just want to laugh because the characters are hilarious but most of all, the writing is just top notch.  And all 22 episodes in the third season does not disappoint at all.With the second season DVD release from last year, the show was really facing major challenges as the Writers Guild Strike really cut down on the episodes and no one knew if NBC was going to cancel the show but they gave it some time and next thing you know, the show won many awards.  The fact that the show has been nominated for 22 awards in 2009 alone is a testament of how people respect the show's writing and its talent.  As mentioned earlier in my review, \"30 ROCK\" is one of those rare and unique shows on television and everything manages to work perfectly.I've watched Season 3 on television and I couldn't wait to watch the episodes again, that's how much I really enjoy this series.  It's witty, fun and comedy that is highly entertaining!  In fact, as for favorite episodes, there is just so many.  From finding out who Liz Lemon was talking to on the plane ride in the episode \"Believe in the Stars\", to see the reuniting of the \"Night Court\" characters and also see Jennifer Aniston's \"Claire\" getting into mischief in \"The One with the Cast of Night Court\", Kenneth going on a date with a blind staffer with Tracy's help in \"St. Valentine's Day\", Jack seeing a duplicate of himself on the Spanish soap opera in \"Generalissimo\" or Liz and Jack visiting Liz's high school reunion in the episode titled \"Reunion\".  There are just too many fantastic episodes from this third season, that I can't see any fan being disappointed.As for the DVD release of \"30 ROCK - Season 3', this DVD is literally a solid release.  Not only do you get all 22 episodes, 7 audio commentary (and the good news is that they give a variety of talent, even guest stars a chance to take part in the audio commentary) but you also get a good number of other special features that really round out this wonderful DVD release.  Overall, the show is wonderful and the only thing I can hope for is that Universal considers releasing \"30 Rock\" on Blu-ray via High Definition.But there is nothing negative I can say about this release.

Indeed, as most SNL-derived comedy, it tends to be somewhat superior in its approach and over-smug. However this show can afford it due to its brilliant acting and writing. Sometimes the humour is of the flat \"I am great\" SNL style but not too often. The show could use a more relaxed kind of comedy sometines but overall it is a joy to wtach and it does deserve all the praise it gets.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Really good!", "unixReviewTime": 1254700800, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2009"},

{"reviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "asin": "B001EXO256", "reviewerName": "Robert Moore", "helpful": [24, 37], "reviewText": "The first two seasons of 30 ROCK the series managed to accumulate every imaginable award, not merely Golden Globes and Emmys, but the highly prestigious Peabody.  TV Critics proclaimed it one of the greatest comedy series in TV history.  Despite all this, no one was watching the series.  NBC renewed it twice simply because it was far and away its most critically acclaimed show.  And as I said, it had a shelf full of awards to prove it.  In accepting the show's first Emmy show creator Tina Fey summed it up perfectly:  \"I'd like to thank our dozens and dozens of viewers.\"Then came the 2008 election and John McCain chose as his running mate a photogenic but outrageously under qualified governor from Alaska.  She was a comically awful choice, but for a while not everyone realized that.  Then on Saturday Night Live Tina Fey returned to portray Sarah Palin.  Her impersonation devastated Palin's public perception and more or less destroyed her political career.  It helped that many of the most hilarious things that she said were incredibly close to what Palin actually said.  While her impersonation was not crucial to McCain's loss, it definitely played a role.  But in addition to the political effects, Tina Fey's Sarah Palin called attention to her and by extension 30 ROCK to a degree not previously possible.  In its third season, 30 ROCK's dozens of fans grew to millions.  NBC suddenly had a hit show.Before going on, we should pause and reflect on this.  Today the networks do not exhibit much patience with shows.  If they are not instant hits, they are canceled.  Even if they get considerable critical acclaim, like PUSHING DAISIES, they will still get canceled.  30 ROCK had survived only because it got such an extreme amount of critical acclaim.  Its critical success more or less tied NBC's hands.  But my point is that after two low rated seasons, the show was a sudden hit.  I wish the networks would keep in mind that great shows always have a chance to become hits.  In fact, they have greater chances than the vast majority of new shows.  Patience with good shows will usually pay off.And what a brilliant show it remained in Season Three.  No doubt their collection of awards will grown once again and it will deserve it.  30 ROCK isn't merely the best comedy show on TV right now, but one of the best ever, possibly the best ever after only ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  Absolutely everything was perfect.  The writing was simply jaw dropping, with the jokes spilling out at a breathtaking pace.  Most comedy shows pad out the script, pacing the jokes because they don't know if they can keep coming up with the good ones, spacing the jokes with mildly humorous dialogue.  That isn't the way of Tina Fey and her team of writers.  They just assault the viewer with jokes, one right after another.  There are so many jokes that you simply can't keep up with them.  You just can't digest all of them.  What is more, sometimes the jokes are presented not one at a time, but in layers, two or three operating at the same time.  The jokes are verbal and they are also visual.  I still can't get the image of Liz Lemon showing her female friends her yoga pose out of my mind.This is as brilliant a set of characters as has been seen since the Bluth family made their premature exit from television.  Liz Lemon is an absolutely brilliant character, a lead character plagued by feet of clay.  Liz never really does the right thing for the right reason, but at most does the right thing for the wrong reasons.  She might not have an evil bone in her body, but neither does she have a good one.  Much the same is true of the magnificently self-absorbed Jack Donaghy.  Everything he does, no matter how bizarre, is done to further the interests of Jack Donaghy.  And Kevin the Page is one of the most unexpected hit characters on TV.  I'm sure when they started the series they knew he was going to be good, but who knew he would be as good as he ended up?  I'm sure they were confident that Tracy Jordan was going to be a great character, and they were right.  And Jenna Maroney might even surpass Liz and Jack in seeing the world as revolving around herself.  What makes this incredible group of characters even more incredible is that every actor portraying them is extraordinary.  Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin are simply the two best comic performers on TV and together they have created one of the great comic duos in TV history.There were some great comic arcs in Season Three.  Jack has a bizarre and out of character romance with his mother's nurse, played by Salma Hayek.  There is an unexpected glitch in it when her mother hates Jack because of his sharp resemblance to a villain in a Mexican soap (the villain is also portrayed by Alec Baldwin).  Liz persists in her efforts to adopt a child.  She also has a near romance with a very good looking neighbor, played to perfection by Jon Hamm, better known as Don Draper on MAD MEN.  Jenna wears herself out by simultaneously continuing to appear in THE GIRLIE SHOW while starring in an unauthorized biopic based on Janis Joplin (its being unauthorized meaning that in singing the Janis-like songs they can't use the real lyrics, something that leads to excellent results).  In short, hilarity results, again and again.The season ends on a highlight.  Jack learns the identity of his father, who just happens to need a kidney.  Much to his relief, Jack learns that he is not compatible, so they need to find a new donor.  So Jack twists the arms of Elvis Costello and other musicians to do a celebrity single.  The season ends with a group of musicians begging in a video for a kidney for Jack's dad.  Those performing on \"Kidney Now!\" include Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Clay Aiken, Mary J. Bilge, Steve Earle, two of the Beastie Boys, Adam Levine of Maroon 5, Norah Jones (who proudly sings that she is sober), Cyndi Lauper (who confesses that she is not), Sara Bareille, Michael Moby, Michael McDonald, rapper Talib Kweli, Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, Rhett Miller of the Old 97s, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata.  All in all, it is a pretty amazing assemblage of talent for a fake music video.So, once again 30 ROCK was a show that was hitting on all cylinders.  And now the ratings are strong enough that those of us who adore the show don't have to worry that the season that has just ended will be the last.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Should be designated a national treasure", "unixReviewTime": 1244332800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2009"},

I bought Seasons 1-3 at a second hand DVD & CD store and it has been an utter pain to sit through every single episode of all three seasons.  It's like torture.

It's hammy, stupid, utterly unrealistic in any possible way, the writing is bad, the acting is horrible.  There are other similar \"loopy and unrealistic\" TV shows, such as Ugly Betty and Scrubs, that work (I love both those shows).  But 30 Rock is just bad.  It doesn't work.  It seems like in every episode they are struggling to make the show funny and the show falls flat on its face every time.  The show's \"stars\" Tina Fey and Tracey Morgan are just not funny at all.  Alec Bladwin is good and kind of funny, but it's almost like you feel bad for him that he's surrounded by such bad actors and given such bad scripts.  And in Season 3 they resort to these super hokey \"guest star\" appearances by people like Steve Martin and Oprah Winfrey that are just super hammy and so painful to watch.

This show needs to do some radical pruning in order to to make it the excellent show which glimmers through the convoluted mess of a plot which tries to drag it under week after week. It is fine that Charlie returns to being a cop after being awarded tons of money for being wrongfully imprisoned for a murder he did not commit.  To have him continually trying to solve how this happened to him is the weakest part of the show and may well sink it.  Here is what will make it the show it deserves to be:  SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF WHO FRAMED CHARLIE, GET RID OF THOSE PEOPLE AND MOVE ON.  Charlie, played by always excellent UK actor Damian Lewis, is best when he devotes himself to the present day problems which confront him.  This doesn't mean that Charlie can't still suffer from his unjustly spent 12 years in prison.  He can still do that.  He just has to be finished with this massive conspiracy inside the police department which framed him for murder and sent him away.  There are plenty of present day aspects which can then be given more attention in the series.  Adam Arkin is excellent as his former cellmate Ted Early, who was a top notch white collar criminal.  Charlie has taken him into his home and life.  Every time Early is onscreen it is magic time. Presently he has fallen in love with Charlie's father's fiance.  This is the father Charlie wants nothing to do with because he believed Charlie had committed the murder.  Again, magic time. Dani Reese (Sara Shahi), as his partner is fine but she was wasted this season being taken away by the people who framed Charlie.

Thurlow", "helpful": [127, 127], "reviewText": "The quirky NBC crime drama \"Life\" gets a second season, featuring understated British actor Damian Lewis as LA detective Charlie Crews, who spent 12 years in prison for a mass murder he didn't commit before returning to duty anchored by the Zen Buddism he learned to survive his incarceration.  His partner is detective Dani Reese (Sara Shahi), recovering substance abuser and daughter of the policeman who may have helped frame Crews.  The pair are assisted by Bobby Stark (Brent Sexton), Crews' last buddy from his former days on the force.  Their new boss is Lieutenant Kevin Tidwell (Donal Logue), a transfer from New York who seems out of place in laid-back LA but who learns to appreciate Crews and Reese for very different reasons.  Adam Arkin returns as Ted Early, once Charlie's white collar criminal cellmate.The new season follows a familar formula: the detectives each week are handed a new case that proves far more complicated than first appearances.  Crews' Zen Buddist approach invariably provides unique, unexpected, and often humorous insights to cases involving, for example, a murder during a student prison experiment, the landing of a plane by a dead astronaut, and the suffocation of a rock star impersonator.The weekly cases also allow the viewer to watch the slow blossoming of the relationship between Crews and a once skeptical Reese.  Crews is by turns a quirky but kind searcher for truth and a shockingly tough cop, a combination Reese learns to value.  As Reese learns the truth about her father, she and Crews will discover they have more in common than just a badge.In a parallel story arc, Crews secretly unravels clues to the conspiracy responsible for his frameup.  That conspiracy has expanded to include a mysterious group of retired policemen, one or more rogue FBI agents, and a charming but ruthless Russian mob boss.  The conspiracy seems uncannily aware of Crews' every move, and acts ruthlessly to protect itself by attacking Crews, sending Ted Early unjustly back to prison, and endangering Dani Reese.  In the outstanding season finale, Crews will combine his Zen and his cop skills to ransom a kidnapped Dani and finally confront a ruthless killer.  Series fans will not be disappointed.\"Life: Season Two\" on DVD is very highly recommended to fans of this unique police procedural.  This reviewer hopes against the ratings numbers that \"Life\" will get a third season.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still Something Different...", "unixReviewTime": 1240099200, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2009"},

While season 1 was relatively straightforward, season 2 is somewhat more complex if not confusing.  For instance, Alan Arkin, who plays Ted and manages Charlie's millions, suddenly has a daughter introduced.  In addition, instead of getting his bullet-ridden Maserati fixed, Charlie starts driving a Buick Grand National.  Then there's the sudden disappearances of Jack Reese and Olivia (the woman Ted likes but who is engaged to Charlie's father).  Furthermore, there's the girl Charlie harbors that the people who framed Charlie are looking for, but seem to have trouble finding . . . even though she lives with him and seems to come and go as she pleases.  There's a whole lot going on and I'm not sure it all needs to, or should.The introduction of Donal Logue as the police captain infuses more life into the already lively \"Life\" show.  And when he kindles a relationship with Crews' partner Dani Reese, played by Sarah Shahi, there are some scenes that simply made me say \"Wow\" (and they had absolutely nothing to do with him and everything to do with her).Garrett Dillahunt returns as Russian mobster Roman Nevikov and the always entertaining William Atherton is introduced as rich ex-policeman Mickey Rayborn.This show actually inspired me to read theThe Wisdom of InsecurityandThe Way of Zenby Alan W. Watts, an English writer and speaker that Damian Lewis supposedly read and listened to for his Zen research.  (Crews discovered Zen philosophy in prison and used it to survive there.  He also listens to Zen philosophy in his car and through an iPod after his reinstatement as a police detective.)Damian Lewis does a fabulous job as the framed police officer trying to find peace in his life.  His offbeat behavior makes for compelling television.  Too bad this show didn't get a third season.

I think the series itself is entertaining, but more importantly I enjoy the ending. I think the best stories end on an open-ended good note, because it seems like the characters could still be alive somewhere in your imagination. I think a lot of stories look too much at making an edgy or new ending and that in doing so, many fail to make a good story. I think this show is the perfect example of how a well-done story can enhance (and make exciting) a \"predictable\" good ending. This is one of my favorite series to watch, but it is my personal favorite as far as how they ended the series. The series has enjoyable characters, the main cast are all likable, and I find the Buddhist concepts to be an interesting step away from the norms in regard to the philosophies on life that the main character has. Some may not like it because he does not follow his own philosophy to the tee, but I think that makes the series better, because it shows that people are imperfect. The thing that makes the main character likable is that he knows he's imperfect, but obviously is trying to improve himself and his quality of well-being to the extent that anyone can.I would recommend the series, and I know I'll be watching it again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I keep coming back to this series", "unixReviewTime": 1351641600, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2012"},

But the cancellation of Life was especially painful. The first season, like many other series, suffered from the writers strike, and only 11 of 22 episodes were made. This didn't stop the creators from producing a quality product, but the reduction in episodes made the tail end of that season feel rushed. The second season has 21 episodes, and they make the most of them.Life succeeds where many shows fail in that the show is able to focus on the main characters lives while still delivering interesting storylines that play off said characters quirks. Some shows feature characters with great chemistry, but the creators seem to think that chemistry is enough to hold a show together. Storylines will often take a back seat to the minutia of the lead characters, and hurt the show.In Life the characters personal problems are intergrated into the storyline making them feel organic, and much more enjoyable to watch. The cases they go on are never normal, but they never cross over into being wacky. The criminals are never your cookie cutter bad guys, but instead individuals with their own unique motivations that make them far more dangerous, and alot more fun to watch.Damian Lewis gives an incredible performance giving his character a wide array of emotions that never feel forced. Sarah Shahi is wonderfully grounded when standing next to Lewis and acts as a friend and not just the straight man that has become standard fare, though she does that very well. The new captain, played to great effect by Donal Logue,  complements the cast perfectly and never feels lile his character was forced on us. When Sarah was with child, Gabrielle Union stepped in and delivered a performance that did not try to copy Sarah's, but made the character her own.This is a phenomenal show that was cancelled long before it's time, and you will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not see it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great show you never saw", "unixReviewTime": 1251504000, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2009"},
